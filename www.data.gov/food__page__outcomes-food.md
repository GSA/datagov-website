This site is a centralized federal resource for Food, Agriculture and Rural data. Here you will find hundreds of government [datasets](/food/page/data-food-community) that can help enable research, tools and decision making to improve food security; [apps](/food/page/food-apps) that demonstrate the power of open data for agriculture; tools for app [developers](http://usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome?navid=USDA_DEVELOPER); and [events](/food/page/events) and opportunities to [collaborate](/food/page/collaborate-food-community) to learn more about Food, Agriculture and Rural data and issues.
