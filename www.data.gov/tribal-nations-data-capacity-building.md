* Guidelines for Considering Traditional Knowledges in Climate Change Initiatives: The Guidelines for Considering Traditional Knowledges in Climate Change Initiatives were developed by the Climate and Traditional Knowledges Workgroup (CTKW), composed of tribal climate experts and partners. Tribes, agencies, and organizations can use this guide as a framework to increase understanding of issues relating to access and protection of traditional knowledges in climate initiatives. It includes both a Primer on Indigenous Peoples and Climate Change and a discussion of ethics to aid understanding and appropriate usage.

* G-WOW Guiding for Tomorrow: Changing Climate, Changing Culture: The “Gikinoo’wizhiwe Onji Waaban” (Guiding for Tomorrow) or “G-WOW” Initiative is a unique approach to increasing awareness of how climate change is affecting Lake Superior’s coastal environment, people, cultures, and economies. G-WOW integrates scientific climate change research with place-based evidence of how climate change is affecting traditional Ojibwe lifeways and people of all cultures. The Initiative brings native perspectives and involvement to addressing issues of climate change by directly engaging native communities, educators, and students, providing learners with knowledge about what they can do to mitigate or adapt to a changing climate.

* Local Environmental Observer (LEO) Network: The Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium (ANTHC) developed the Local Environmental Observer (LEO) network to assist Alaska Native participants, called “LEOs”, post unique or unusual environmental events onto public, web-based maps. The LEO network provides a model for connecting community members with technical experts and resources and is expanding to other regions of the United States and the Arctic.

* Seven Generations – Community Based Environmental Planning: The Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium (ANTHC) developed the Seven Generations (7G) manual, training, and outreach program to assist Alaska Native communities to adopt an environmental planning process to recognize climate impacts and build community capacity for resilience from which other Tribal Nations may also benefit. The Tool is called “Seven Generations” because many Tribal Nations hold in common a policy to consider many future generations in community decision-making to focus on long-term sustainability.

* Tribal Climate Change Adaptation Planning Toolkit: The Northern Arizona University Institute for Tribal Environmental Professionals (ITEP) established its [Tribal Climate Change (TCC) Program](http://www7.nau.edu/itep/main/tcc/Home/) in 2009 to provide support and be responsive to the needs of tribes that are preparing for and currently contending with climate change impacts. This program offers training, technical assistance, educational resources, and tools to build the capacity of tribes to address climate change impacts. Tribal Climate Change Adaptation Planning Toolkit collection of templates and other resources assists tribes in their climate change adaptation planning process. The [Bureau of Indian Affairs Climate Change Program](http://www.indianaffairs.gov/WhoWeAre/BIA/climatechange/index.htm) provides annual travel support grants to permit tribes to attend this and other climate trainings and helps fund the TCC program.
