* BioPower Atlas: BioPower is an interactive map for comparing biomass feedstocks and biopower by location. This tool helps users select from and apply biomass data layers to a map as well as query and download biopower and feedstock data. The analysis function offers common conversion factors that allow users to determine the potential biopower production for a selected feedstock in a specific area.
