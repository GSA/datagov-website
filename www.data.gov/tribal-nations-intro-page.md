Tribal Nations [data](https://www.data.gov/climate/tribal-nations/data-page) and [maps](https://www.data.gov/climate/tribal-nations/tribal-nations-maps) found here will supplement other Climate Themes in assisting Tribes to build Climate Resilience.  Federally-recognized Tribes are also directed to the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) [Tribal Climate Resilience Program](https://www.bia.gov/WhoWeAre/BIA/climatechange/) for direct climate data and analysis support, to [Tribal Fact Sheets](https://www.bia.gov/WhoWeAre/BIA/climatechange/Resources/Tribes/index.htm) in the Tribal Resilience Resource Guide for site-specific data and federal-wide resources, and to the BIA [Branch of Geospatial Services](http://www.bia.gov/WhatWeDo/ServiceOverview/Geospatial/index.htm) for free ESRI GIS software, training, and usage support.


Tribal Nations are disproportionately affected by climate change, yet many lead the nation in building awareness and addressing climate impacts to their traditional lifeways. Through renewable energy installations and energy efficiency projects, Tribal Nations also address the causes of climate change, while focusing on sustainable community development in a culturally appropriate context.   Tribal Tools and Examples demonstrate innovations in six integrated resilience strategies, which may support other U.S. and international communities. These include:


* [Assessment and Planning](https://toolkit.climate.gov/topics/tribal-nations/assessment-and-planning)
* [Adaptation](https://toolkit.climate.gov/topics/tribal-nations/adaptation)
* [Mitigation](https://toolkit.climate.gov/topics/tribal-nations/mitigation)
* [Disaster Risk Reduction](https://toolkit.climate.gov/topics/tribal-nations/disaster-risk-reduction)
* [Relocation](https://toolkit.climate.gov/topics/tribal-nations/relocation)
* [Capacity Building](https://toolkit.climate.gov/topics/tribal-nations/capacity-building)


To discover how the 567 federally recognized tribes in the U.S. are addressing climate challenges and building resilience, explore the [U.S. Climate Resilience Toolkit](http://toolkit.climate.gov/) topic area for [Tribal Nations](https://toolkit.climate.gov/topics/tribal-nations).

Alaska Native communities comprise 229 of the 567 federally recognized tribes (about 40 percent). Their stories of adjusting to climate impacts associated with rising temperatures, melting sea ice and glaciers, and thawing permafrost can also be found in the [Arctic topic](https://toolkit.climate.gov/regions/alaska-and-arctic) in the [Climate Resilience Toolkit](http://toolkit.climate.gov/). See also the [Arctic Theme](http://www.data.gov/climate/arctic/) here for related data, tools, and featured content.


To partner effectively with tribes on climate data initiatives, the first step is carefully reviewing components included in the [Guidelines for Considering Traditional Knowledges in Climate Change Initiatives](https://toolkit.climate.gov/tool/guidelines-considering-traditional-knowledges-climate-change-initiatives).


Data sharing limitations to Tribal Nations data selection and thematic content and how to better interpret Indian Lands and related rights are discussed in the [framing questions](http://www.data.gov/climate/tribal-nations/framing-questions). We welcome your [feedback](http://www.data.gov/climate/climate-feedback/) on how we can make these data and resources more useful for tribes and climate.
