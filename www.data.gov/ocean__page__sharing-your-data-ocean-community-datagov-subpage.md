Federal Publishers


Under  the [Open Data Policy](http://project-open-data.github.io/), Federal agencies are required to make their publicly available data accessible in machine-readable formats. Each agency has an established *agency*.gov/data website where datasets are posted.  These websites feed into the Data.gov catalog to support a uniform search and discovery capability across the Federal government.


For further information about the Open Data Policy and to access publishing guidelines, please visit the following:


* [Project Open Data](http://project-open-data.github.io/)
* [Implementation Guide](http://project-open-data.github.io/implementation-guide/)
* [Common Core Metadata Schema](http://project-open-data.github.io/schema/)


Non-Federal Publishers


The [catalog](http://catalog.data.gov) utilized by Data.gov and [Geoplatform.gov,](Geoplatform.gov) allows any organization or entity to register and publish geospatial metadata to the system.  The following “how-to” guide will step you through the process of registering your organization with Data.gov.
