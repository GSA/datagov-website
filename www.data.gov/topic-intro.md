Here you will find resources related to the effects of climate change on water resources, as well as other water-related environmental and societal themes. Citizens, businesses, non-governmental agencies and governments can use these resources to be better prepared for climate-related impacts on water resources. You may access the [framing questions](http://www.data.gov/climate/water-framing-questions "framing questions") used to select the data and content available for this theme.  We welcome your [feedback](https://www.data.gov/climate/climate-feedback/) on how we can make these data and resources more useful.
