* Coastal Change Analyses for Western Alaska: Interactive Map: Covering the entire extent of the Western Alaska Landscape Conservation Cooperative’s area, this analyses provide important baseline information on the distribution and magnitude of landscape changes from erosion and aggradation (deposition) over 41 years. The maps document changes in the shape and extent of land, as well as in coastal features such as spits, barrier islands, estuaries, tidal guts, and lagoons. Western Alaska Native coastal communities may use this mapping tool to summarize changes for various parcels of land or assess the extent of habitat loss or gain over the study period.

* Imiq Data Portal: The word imiq means “freshwater” in the Inupiat language of Northern Alaska. The Imiq Data Portal provides a snapshot of available hydroclimate data: a map-based view shows where, what, and when data have been obtained. Users can submit a custom data query, specifying variable of interest, geographic bounds, and time step. Imiq will aggregate and export data records from multiple sources in a common format, with full metadata records that provide information about the source data.

* Indigenous Health Indicators Tool: The Indigenous Health Indicators (IHIs) are meant to provide a clear and broadly understandable depiction of what it means to be healthy for many indigenous communities, as well as a method for evaluating the status of health and well-being. IHIs were developed by Swinomish and Sauk-Suiattle Indian Tribes with federal partners. Tribal Nations can use this tool — which incorporates connections to ecosystem health and social/cultural beliefs — to better evaluate and manage public environmental health risks and impacts aligned with their value systems.

* Pan Inuit Trails Atlas: This tool looks at Inuit occupancy of the Northwest Passage through documentation of Inuit traditional trails and place names, which have interconnected Inuit groups across the Arctic since time immemorial. Although they are not permanent features on the landscape, delineations of trails and place names play a critical role in documenting the Inuit spatial narratives about their homelands. The atlas offers map- and text-based searches to help users find material obtained from hundreds of published and unpublished documents.

* Seven Generations – Community Based Environmental Planning: The Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium (ANTHC) developed the Seven Generations (7G) manual, training, and outreach program to assist Alaska Native communities to adopt an environmental planning process to recognize climate impacts and build community capacity for resilience from which other Tribal Nations may also benefit. The Tool is called “Seven Generations” because many Tribal Nations hold in common a policy to consider many future generations in community decision-making to focus on long-term sustainability.

* Tribal Climate Change Adaptation Planning Toolkit: The Northern Arizona University Institute for Tribal Environmental Professionals (ITEP) established its [Tribal Climate Change (TCC) Program](http://www7.nau.edu/itep/main/tcc/Home/) in 2009 to provide support and be responsive to the needs of tribes that are preparing for and currently contending with climate change impacts. This program offers training, technical assistance, educational resources, and tools to build the capacity of tribes to address climate change impacts. Tribal Climate Change Adaptation Planning Toolkit collection of templates and other resources assists tribes in their climate change adaptation planning process. The [Bureau of Indian Affairs Climate Change Program](http://www.indianaffairs.gov/WhoWeAre/BIA/climatechange/index.htm) provides annual travel support grants to permit tribes to attend this and other climate trainings and helps fund the TCC program.
