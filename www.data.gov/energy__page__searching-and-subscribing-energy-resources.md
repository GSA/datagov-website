New energy data is made available daily, and while federal agencies, cities, states, and others work to integrate those datasets fully into Energy.data.gov, below are ways to search the very latest information in energy data.


* Use our federated search widget to search Energy.data.gov and other energy data sites.  

 Enter Search Term(s):
* [Looking for structured data from Energy.data.gov and OpenEI (Open Energy Information)? Browse our RDF triplestore!](http://logd.tw.rpi.edu/demo/international_dataset_catalog_search) This features an efficient, reconfigurable faceted browser with search capabilities offering a compelling demonstration of the value of a common metadata model for open government dataset catalogs.
* See the latest new buildings datasets via RSS feed from Open EI


Energy.data.gov will showcase new datasets about federal energy use as the data becomes available to the public. By the end of the year, Energy.data.gov will feature detailed datasets on Federal agency facility energy use and their prospects for energy efficiency improvements, as well as the Federal Governmentâ€™s historical energy consumption and costs data back to 1975 by agency, end-use sector, and energy type.
