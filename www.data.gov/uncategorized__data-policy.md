### Linking to Data.gov


[Data.gov](http://www.data.gov) is the official portal for open data from the U.S. government. It is a public domain website, which means you may link to Data.gov at no cost.  When you link to Data.gov, please do it in an appropriate context as a service to people when they need to find official U.S. government data. We encourage you to use our logo, which we’ve provided below. Placement of the Data.gov logo is to be used only as a marker to the home page and not as a form of endorsement or approval from Data.gov, the Office of Citizen Services and Innovative Technologies, the U.S. General Services Administration, or the U.S. Government.


### Licensing


* U.S. Federal data available through Data.gov is offered free and without restriction. Data and content created by government employees within the scope of their employment are not subject to domestic copyright protection under 17 U.S.C. § 105.
* Non-federal data available through Data.gov may have a different licensing method as noted under “Show more” at the bottom of the dataset page. Non-federal data can be identified by name of the publisher and the diagonal banner that shows up on the search results and data set pages. Federal data will have a banner noting “Federal” and non-federal banners will note “University”, “Multiple Sources”, “State”, etc.


### Use of Logo


* The image below is the official Data.gov logo.
