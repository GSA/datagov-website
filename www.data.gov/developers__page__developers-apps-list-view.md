Apps and Tools are at the heart of enabling developers to get their projects completed effectively. Below you’ll find work underway or tools available to you in the areas of metadata, APIs, vocabularies, and training.

* Each of Data.gov’s interactive datasets have a published API, which you can see at <http://explore.data.gov/catalog/next-gen>. APIs are also published by agencies at <http://explore.data.gov/browse?Dataset-Information_Extended-Type=Data+Extraction+Tool&q=api>.
* Ready to try building a mashup or application? To get started, check out the [tutorials](http://logd.tw.rpi.edu/tutorials) and [videos](http://logd.tw.rpi.edu/videos) that will help you. If you would like examples of what other people are doing, check out applications developed by the [government](https://explore.data.gov/catalog/apps).
