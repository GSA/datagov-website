1) How are fundamental energy resources impacted by climate?


2) How might changes in climate and natural resource availability impact energy conversion infrastructure and processes?


3) How might climate impact energy transmission and distribution systems?


4) How might energy demands be impacted by climate change, including heating and cooling but also energy losses and energy used for adaptation by other sectors?


5) What capacity do we currently have to adapt energy systems, and how might technology solutions, systems designs, and operational changes improve energy system resilience for climate change?


6) How might climate change impact energy infrastructure and its interactions with networked and interconnected infrastructure systems?
