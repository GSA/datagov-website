### National Water Information System


[National Water Information System](http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis)


NWIS provides access to water-resources data collected at approximately 1.5 million sites in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.The USGS investigates the occurrence, quantity, quality, distribution, and movement of surface and underground waters and disseminates the data to the public, State and local governments, public and private utilities, and other Federal agencies involved with managing our water resources.


### National Weather Service Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service


[National Weather Service Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service](http://water.weather.gov/ahps/)


AHPS is a web-based suite of accurate and information-rich forecast products. They display the magnitude and uncertainty of occurrence of floods or droughts, from hours to days and months, in advance. These graphical products are useful information and planning tools for many economic and emergency managers. These new products will enable government agencies, private institutions, and individuals to make more informed decisions about risk based policies and actions to mitigate the dangers posed by floods and droughts.


### National Groundwater Monitoring Network


[National Groundwater Monitoring Network](http://cida.usgs.gov/ngwmn/)


The NGWMN Data Portal provides access to groundwater data from multiple, dispersed databases in a web-based mapping application. The portal contains current and historical data including water levels, water quality, lithology, and well construction.


### Water Quality Portal


[Water Quality Portal](http://www.waterqualitydata.us)


The Water Quality Portal (WQP) is a cooperative service sponsored by the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the National Water Quality Monitoring Council (NWQMC). It serves data collected by over 400 state, federal, tribal, and local agencies.


### Downscaled CMIP3 and CMIP5 Climate and Hydrology Projections


[Downscaled CMIP3 and CMIP5 Climate and Hydrology Projections](http://gdo-dcp.ucllnl.org/downscaled_cmip_projections/dcpInterface.html)


“Downscaled” (finer-resolution) versions of monthly and daily temperature and precipitation from most of the GCM simulations in the PCMDI CMIP3 and CMIP5 archives, for CONUS, using two downscaling methods. In addition, derived simulations of surface hydrology are provided.


### National Climatic Data Center Climate Data Online


[National Climatic Data Center Climate Data Online](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/)


Climate Data Online (CDO) provides free access to NCDC’s archive of historical weather and climate data in addition to station history information. These data include quality controlled daily, monthly, seasonal, and yearly measurements of temperature, precipitation, wind, and degree days as well as radar data and 30-year Climate Normals.


### USDA FS Climate Change Resource Center


[USDA FS Climate Change Resource Center](http://www.fs.usda.gov/ccrc/)


The Climate Change Resource Center (CCRC) is a web-based, national resource that connects land managers and decisionmakers with useable science to address climate change in planning and application.


### NASA Hydrology Data and Information Services Center


[NASA Hydrology Data and Information Services Center](http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/hydrology)


The Hydrology DISC supports data products generated by Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center Hydrological Sciences Branch. Data products from the North America Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) and the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) can be accessed through several interfaces. NLDAS and GLDAS systems integrate data from multiple space-based Earth observing systems using advanced land surface modeling and assimilation techniques. These products support weather and climate forecast experiments, water resources applications, and water and energy cycle research.
