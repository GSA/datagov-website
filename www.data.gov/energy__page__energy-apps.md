While we can’t and don’t endorse specific apps, below are just a few examples of government, citizen, and business tools that: use open government data from the United States; are accessible, vetted, and available; and are, for the majority, free and do not require registration to use. Submit Energy application suggestions at [Contact Energy](https://www.data.gov/energy/contact/).


For more examples of energy applications made with open government data see [OpenEI – Energy Apps Catalog](http://en.openei.org/apps/ "http://en.openei.org/apps/") and [Data.gov/applications](https://www.data.gov/applications "Data.gov/Applications").
