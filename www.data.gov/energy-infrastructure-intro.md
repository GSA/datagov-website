In an effort to enhance future energy security and the underlying knowledge foundations, the Energy and Infrastructure Resilience theme contains federal data, tools, and publications that inform various aspects of how energy and infrastructure systems could be impacted by climate change as well as how they might adapt to become more climate resilient. Citizens, businesses, non-governmental agencies, governments, and research institutions may find improved accessibility to these resources useful in better understanding and preparing for climate-related impacts on energy and infrastructure.


You may access the [framing questions](http://www.data.gov/climate/energy-infrastructure/energy-infrastructure-framing-questions/) used to select the data and content available for this theme.  We welcome your [feedback](https://www.data.gov/climate/climate-feedback/) on how we can make these data and resources more useful.
