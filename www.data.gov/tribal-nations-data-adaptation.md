* Climate Registry for the Assessment of Vulnerability (CRAVe): As more Tribal Nations complete climate adaptation plans, and begin more in-depth resource analysis, they can find existing vulnerability assessments by geographic area, assessment target, sponsoring agency, and other factors. Registered users can also enter basic information about a vulnerability assessment, enabling colleagues, partners, and others to learn and benefit from their work. Existing Tribal Nations contributions may be found in the Other Regions section of the location-based search.

* Guidelines for Considering Traditional Knowledges in Climate Change Initiatives: The Guidelines for Considering Traditional Knowledges in Climate Change Initiatives were developed by the Climate and Traditional Knowledges Workgroup (CTKW), composed of tribal climate experts and partners. Tribes, agencies, and organizations can use this guide as a framework to increase understanding of issues relating to access and protection of traditional knowledges in climate initiatives. It includes both a Primer on Indigenous Peoples and Climate Change and a discussion of ethics to aid understanding and appropriate usage.

* G-WOW Guiding for Tomorrow: Changing Climate, Changing Culture: The “Gikinoo’wizhiwe Onji Waaban” (Guiding for Tomorrow) or “G-WOW” Initiative is a unique approach to increasing awareness of how climate change is affecting Lake Superior’s coastal environment, people, cultures, and economies. G-WOW integrates scientific climate change research with place-based evidence of how climate change is affecting traditional Ojibwe lifeways and people of all cultures. The Initiative brings native perspectives and involvement to addressing issues of climate change by directly engaging native communities, educators, and students, providing learners with knowledge about what they can do to mitigate or adapt to a changing climate.

* Indigenous Health Indicators Tool: The Indigenous Health Indicators (IHIs) are meant to provide a clear and broadly understandable depiction of what it means to be healthy for many indigenous communities, as well as a method for evaluating the status of health and well-being. IHIs were developed by Swinomish and Sauk-Suiattle Indian Tribes with federal partners. Tribal Nations can use this tool — which incorporates connections to ecosystem health and social/cultural beliefs — to better evaluate and manage public environmental health risks and impacts aligned with their value systems.

* Local Environmental Observer (LEO) Network: The Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium (ANTHC) developed the Local Environmental Observer (LEO) network to assist Alaska Native participants, called “LEOs”, post unique or unusual environmental events onto public, web-based maps. The LEO network provides a model for connecting community members with technical experts and resources and is expanding to other regions of the United States and the Arctic.
