At the Camp David Summit in 2012, G-8 and African leaders committed to the New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition. In partnership with Africaâ€™s people and leaders, the goals are to increase responsible domestic and foreign private investments in African agriculture, take innovations that can enhance agricultural productivity to scale, and reduce the risk borne by vulnerable economies and communities. This community and the G-8 international conference on Open Data for Agriculture fulfill the commitment to share relevant agricultural data taking into account existing data systems, and seeks to develop options for the establishment of global platforms to make reliable agricultural and related information available to African farmers, researchers and policymakers.
