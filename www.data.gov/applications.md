Open government data powers software applications that help people make informed decisions – from choosing financial aid options for college to finding the safest consumer products and vehicles. Below are just a few examples of government, community, and business tools that: **use open government data from the United States**; are **accessible, vetted, and available**; and are, for the majority, **free and do not require registration to use**. While we don’t endorse any particular app, we’re always interested in new examples: Submit application suggestions [here](https://docs.google.com/a/gsa.gov/forms/d/140Rfgtts0FHaEMZyfjXhwFGd1h2o_YXrTc22Ye0BWc4/viewform).  

  

For more examples of applications made with open government data see [Civic Commons](http://wiki.civiccommons.org/App_catalogs) and [USA.gov’s Federal Mobile Apps Directory](http://www.usa.gov/mobileapps.shtml).
