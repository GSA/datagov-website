Extreme heat and precipitation, air pollution, diseases carried by vectors, and food and water-borne illnesses are just some of the topics addressed in these resources. Citizens, businesses, non-governmental agencies, and governments can use these resources to better prepare for climate-related impacts on health. You may access the [framing questions](http://www.data.gov/climate/human-health-framing-questions "Human Health Framing Questions") used to select the data and content available for this theme.  We welcome your [feedback](https://www.data.gov/climate/climate-feedback/) on how we can make these data and resources more useful.
