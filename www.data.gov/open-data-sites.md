Data.gov is leading the way in democratizing public sector data and driving innovation. This movement has spread throughout cities, states, and countries.


We are encouraging and working with countries, cities, and organizations internationally, who have launched their own sites with access to machine-readable data. Details on open data sites in the United States can be found by clicking on the map of the Unites States. The maps for other countries link to the national open data site. If a country has both national and local open data sites, these are noted by clicking on the flag for that country below.
