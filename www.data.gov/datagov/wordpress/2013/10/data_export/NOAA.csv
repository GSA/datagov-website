"Community Collaborative Rain, Hail and Snow Observations (CoCoRaHS) ","The National Weather Service (NWS) supports the Community Collaborative Rain, Hail and Snow (CoCoRaHS) network.  CoCoRaHS is a unique, non-profit, community-based network of volunteers of all ages and backgrounds working together to measure and map precipitation (rain, snow and hail). The network has over 6,500 observers in 26 states. Once trained, volunteers collect data using standardized, low cost measuring tools such as a 4-inch diameter high capacity rain gage, snow boards to measure snow, and aluminum foil-wrapped Styrofoam hail pads in some states. This site has been compiled by NWS and contains the results of the observations and data collection activities of these volunteers across a broad swath of the United States.","Rain, snow, hail, amount, GIS, KML, federal datasets, federal data download, Severe, Weather, GIS, environment, kml, kmz, snowfall, weather, forecast, Severe Weather, Storms",daily,"Department of Commerce","Robert Bunge, 301-713-1381 x140",robert.bunge@noaa.gov,DOC-42,public,,http://www.srh.noaa.gov/gis/kml/cocorahs/cocorahsLink.kml,kml,,,"United States and territories",daily,unknown,daily,,Latitude/Longitude,,"Section 6.

"Marine Cadastre National Viewer","The NOAA Coastal Services Center (CSC) and the DOI Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (BOEM), in cooperation with federal and state partners, have created a GIS-based marine information system for U.S. waters.  The Multipurpose Marine Cadastre (MMC) data viewer is an integrated marine information system that provides legal, physical, ecological, and cultural information in a common geographic information system (GIS) framework. In particular, the MMC would be beneficial to those involved in coastal and marine spatial planning efforts that involve finding the best location for renewable energy projects. Users pick the ocean geography of their choosing and quickly see the applicable jurisdictional boundaries, restricted areas, laws, critical habitat locations, and other important features. With the MMC, potential conflicts can be identified and avoided early in the planning process. The MMC is also a helpful tool in the permit review process. All organizations considering an offshore activity can benefit from this comprehensive, visual approach to data analysis.

"Ocean Surface Current Simulator","The Ocean Surface Current Simulator (OSCURS) numerical model is a research tool that allows oceanographers and fisheries scientists to perform retrospective analyses of daily ocean surface currents anywhere in an ocean-wide grid of 90 km cells that stretches from Baja California to China and from 10 degrees north of the equator to the Bering Strait.  This model is used to measure the movement of surface currents over time, as well as the movement of what is in or on the water.  Ocean surface currents affect organisms suspended in the water column - such as fish eggs, small larvae, and plankton - and may affect their survival by determining their location after a few months of drift.  Even swimming or migrating fish or mammals may have their destinations significantly offset by currents or the annual variability of currents.  OSCURS has gained visibility as an accidental debris tracker to analyze accidental but fortuitous at-sea events beyond the scale of normal oceanographic science.

"Reanalysis Intercomparison and Observations  ","Reanalysis is a scientific method to combine observations and models for developing a comprehensive record of how weather and climate are changing over time. A reanalysis dataset typically extends over several decades or longer, and covers the entire globe from the Earth's surface to well above the stratosphere.  Reanalysis products are used extensively in climate research and services, including for monitoring and comparing current climate conditions with those of the past, identifying the causes of climate variations and change, and preparing climate predictions. Recently, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Aeronautical and Space Administration (NASA), European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), and Japanese Meterological Agency (JMA) have produced new reanalysis datasets that, in total, span 1871 to present. It is crucial to our scientific understanding of climate variability and change that these new datasets be validated and compared with each other and with the underlying observations. International working groups of the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS, the climate element of the Global Earth Observing System of Systems) and the World Climate Research Program, and the Atmospheric Circulation Reconstruction over the Earth (ACRE) initiative need a community portal to exchange quickly and disseminate publicly results of such intercomparisons. NOAA's own mission and strategic goals regarding reanalyzes, as well as its leading role in the US Global Change Research Program, GCOS, WCRP, and ACRE, make NOAA the logical and obvious choice to serve a website dedicated to improving understanding of the international reanalysis datasets, including those recently generated by NOAA, the 20th Century Reanalysis and Climate Forecast System Reanalysis.  The new website ""reanalyses.org"" will serve as a central portal for Reanalysis Intercomparison and Observations (RIO) by NOAA, NASA, ECMWF, JMA, and national and international scientists. The website should be outside the ""noaa.gov"" domain. It will help NOAA and the international scientific community to improve the climate science and services that reanalyzes underpin.NOAA strategic plans and US Global Climate Research Program plans to which NOAA Office of Atmospheric Research and the new NOAA Climate Service will respond specifically call for advances in understanding reanalysis datasets. The RIO will coordinate with the NOAA Climate Services portal to make the intercomparison and observation documentation public.  ","pressure, MSL, humidity, SST, sea ice, global, upper-level winds, ozone, meridional winds, zonal winds, u-wind, v-wind, geopotential height,  temperature, solar radiation,  convection, potential energy, gravity wave, cloud liquid, omega,  vertical velocity,  water, precipitable water,  cloud microphysics, carbon dioxide,  volcano, aerosol, grids, soil moisture, soil temperature, CAPE, CIN, albedo, ground heat, planetary boundary height, ice concentration, ice thickness, latent heat flux, potential evaporation, runoff, sensible heat, snow depth, snow cover, cloud cover, transpiration, momentum flux, wspd, hydrological, dewpoint, precipitation, radiance, TOVS, SSM/I, ERS, ATOVS, GATE, FGGE, ALPEX, TOGA-COARE, ECMWF, NCEP, AVHRR, ERA, MERRA, solar flux, radiation flux, GEOS-5, CFSR, GDAS, turbulence, chemistry, transport, thickness, radiation, diffusivity, cloud-top roughness, snowfall, emissivity, longwave, shortwave, optical, greeness, evaporation, LAI, sublimation, PDR, kinetic energy, NARR, freezing, detrainment, radiosonde, dropsonde, aircraft, balloon, ship, buoy, wind profiler, RAOB, ITOVS ",2010,"Department of Commerce","NOAA/ESRL PSD Data Management",cathy.smith@noaa.gov,DOC-4253,public,http://reanalyses.org/atmosphere/overview-current-reanalyses,http://reanalyses.org/atmosphere/how-obtainplotanalyze-data,netcdf3,,,"Global ",1871-Present,2010,"Hourly, Daily, Monthly ",,"output:  grid (Varies)  ",,"Section 6.

"Coastwatch ","NOAA CoastWatch was established in 1987 in response to two significant environmental events. A Harmful Algal Bloom (HAB) event occurred off the coast of North Carolina transporting the toxic Gymnodinium breve cells from Florida via the Gulf Stream into the colder coastal waters near Cape Lookout. Also, a severe mammal die-off occurred, where more than 700 bottlenose dolphins died off the mid-Atlantic coast. Both instances prompted Federal and State officials to explore additional data sources for monitoring the coastal waters, such as near real-time satellite data.CoastWatch has expanded from POES/AVHRR SST data for the East Coast to providing a variety of environmental data (i.e. SST, ocean color, winds, etc.) from several different satellite platforms covering all U.S. coastal waters, including Hawaii and Alaska. Today, sea surface temperature maps support meteorological weather predictions and also support commercial and recreational activities (e.g., fishing). Biologists utilize ocean color radiometry data and derived chlorophyll-a and total suspended matter/turbidity products to identify runoff plumes and blooms and also predict HABs; and sailors and commercial shipping pilots use ocean surface vector winds for safe navigation.","buoys, radar, satellites, shore,   SST, salinity, currents, upwelling, temperature, waves, winds, SLP, pressure, salinity, PH, turbidity, chlorophyll, CoastWatch, POES, AVHRR, MODIS, Ocean Color, Clarity, Terra, Aqua, SeaWiFs,HAB, Algal Bloom, Envisat,   OrbView-2, GOES, SEVERI, Meteosat, QuikSCAT, DMSP,  SSM/I, Reflectance, Ice Coverage, Altimeter,  Carbon Dioxide,Volcano, Visible, Infrared, biology, sea nettles, primary productivity, OSCAR, roughness, oil spill, MOBY, CBOS, hurricane, storm runoff, plumes, hazard, fronts, eddies   ",2010,"Department of Commerce","Kent Hughes ",Kent.Hughes@noaa.gov,DOC-4267,public,http://coastwatch.noaa.gov/cwn/cw_resources.html,http://coastwatch.noaa.gov/cwn/search/interface.html,"HDF, GeoTIFF, PNG, Shapefile",,,"Global ",1995-2010,1996,"Daily, Hourly ",,,,"Section 6.

"Global Drifter Program ","The Global Drifter Program consists of the two components:  The Drifter Data Assembly Center and the Operations Center.  The primary goal of the DAC is to assemble and provide uniform quality control of sea surface temperature (SST) and surface velocity measurements. These measurements are obtained as part of an international program designed to make these data available in an effort to improve climate prediction. Climate prediction models require accurate estimates of SST to initialize their ocean component. Drifting buoys provide essential ground truth SST data for this purpose. The models also require validation by comparison with independent data sets. Surface velocity measurements are used for this validation.The AOML Drifter Operations Center manages the deployment of drifting buoys around the world. Using research ships, Volunteer Observation Ships (VOS) and aircraft, Lagrangian drifters are placed in areas of interest. Once verified operational, they are reported to AOML's Drifter Data Assembly Center. Incoming data from the drifters are then placed on the Global Telecommunications System (GTS) for distribution to meteorological services everywhere.

NDBC provides regular observations from a network of about 110 buoys and 60 Coastal Marine Automated Network (C-MAN) stations, and 55 Tropical Atmosphere Ocean (TAO) stations, to help meet these needs. All stations measure wind speed, direction, and gust; barometric pressure; and air temperature. In addition, all buoy stations, and some C-MAN stations, measure sea surface temperature and wave height and period. Conductivity and water current are measured at selected stations. NDBC also operates an array of 39 DART (Tsunami) stations.

Today, sea surface temperature maps support meteorological weather predictions and also support commercial and recreational activities (e.g., fishing). Biologists utilize ocean color radiometry data and derived chlorophyll-a and total suspended matter/turbidity products to identify runoff plumes and blooms and also predict HABs; and sailors and commercial shipping pilots use ocean surface vector winds for safe navigation.","abundance, ADCP, air, algae, altitude, ammonia, ammonium, amphipods, AMSR-E, anchovy, anomaly, Aqua, Argo, ASCAT, atlas, attenuation, Average, AVHRR, Aviso, barometric, biology, birds, blended, bottle, bucket, buoy, buoyancy, buoyancy flux, CalCOFI, California, catch, CCMP, cetacean, Channel Islands, Chlorophyll, Chlorophyll-a, CLAVR-1, Climatology, Cloudmask, CM2, CO-OPS, coast, coastal, commercial, common name, composite, concentration, conductivity, contaminants, coral, coverage, CTD, current, currents, DAPPER, debris, density, depth, deviation, diet, diffuse, diffusivity, direction, dissolved, dominant, downward, dynamic height, Ekman, evaporation, family, Farallon, Fish, FishBase, Fisheries, floor, fluorescence, flux, FNMOC, forcing, forecast, forest, front, fronts, gear, genus, geopotential heights, Geostrophic, GFDL, GhostNet, GHRSST, Global, GLOBEC, GNOME, GOES, GoMOOS, grid, groundfish, GTSPP, Gulf of Mexico, Hadley, heat, heat flux, HF, HF Radar, humidity, HYCOM, ice, ICOADS, Imager, island, isotherm, kelp, LAC, landings, larvae, latent heat, latitude, longitude, longwave, mammals, market, meridional, meteorology, METOP, mixed layer, MOCNESS, model, MODIS, NAVO, NCDC, NCOM, NDBC, near real time, NERACOOS, net, nitrate, nitrite, nitrogen, NOI, NOS, NPP, NRL, nutrients, OBIS, Ocean, ocean color, optical, Orbview-2, OSCAR, Oscillations, OSCURS, oxygen, PAR, Pathfinder, percent, phaeopigment, phenology, phosphate, photosynthetic, PIRATA, plankton, POES, POP, precipitation, predators, pressure, primary production, primary productivity, probability, productivity, profile, quality, QuikSCAT, radar, radiation, rainfall, RAMA, reef, relative humidity, relief, rockfish, Rosette, Rrs667, salinity, sample, sardine, satellite, science quality, scientific name, sea, sea level, sea surface height, sea surface temperature, seabird, SEAMAP, seawater, SeaWIFS, secchi, shortwave, sigma-theta, significant, silicate, SODA, SOI, SOS, species, speed, SSH, SST, stabilization, statistics, stress, surface, survey, swell, TAO, TAO/TRITON, taxonomy, temperature, tendancy, Terra, tides, time, time series, timeseries, topography, transports, trawl, TRITON, turtles, upward, upwelling, utilization, visibility, watch, water, wave, waves, wind, winds, WOA, World Ocean Atlas, zonal",8/1/2011,"Department of Commerce","Bob Simons, IT Specialist ",Bob.Simons@noaa.gov,DOC-5263,public,http://coastwatch.pfel.noaa.gov/erddap/index.html,http://coastwatch.pfel.noaa.gov/erddap/index.html,"Web tool",,,"Global ",1800-2011,5/6/2008,"Minutely, Hourly, Daily, Monthly, Quarterly, Seasonal, Annual ",,"longitude/latitude pair ",,"Section 6.

"The National Water Level Observation Network ","The fundamental observational component of the National Water Level Program (NWLP) is the National Water Level Observation Network (NWLON). The NWLON is a network of 200+ long-term, continuously operating water-level stations throughout the USA, including its island possessions and territories and the Great Lakes. The NWLON has expanded over time in response to increasing national and local needs. NWLON stations are the foundation for reference stations for NOAA's tide prediction products, and serve as controls in determining tidal datums for all short-term water-level stations. NWLON has taken advantage of technological advancements in sensors, data collection and data communications which have enabled routine real-time automated and event-driven data acquisition using the GOES satellite. NWLON data-collection platforms are capable of measuring other oceanographic parameters in addition to water levels, including meteorological parameters. Because of these advancements, the application of NWLON data and products has broadened. For instance, the NWLON is a key part of the NOAA Tsunami Warning System and the NOAA Storm Surge Warning System. NWLON stations support Physical Oceanographic Real-Time Systems (PORTS) in major ports and harbors. NWLON stations have standard configurations of water level sensors (including backup sensors), backup and primary data-collection platforms, solar panel power, GOES satellite radios, and telephone modems. Sensors are calibrated and vertically referenced to nearby networks of benchmarks. The data continuity, the vertical stability and careful referencing of NWLON stations have enabled the data to be used to estimate relative sea-level trends for the Nation.","tides, prediction, tidal, water levels, currents, salinity, winds, pressure, temperature, SST ",2011,"Department of Commerce","User Services Center for Operational Products and Services (CO-OPS)",CO-OPS.USERSERVICES@noaa.gov,DOC-5267,public,http://www.tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/publications/glossary2.pdf,http://www.tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/nwlon.html,"CSV/TXT, PDF, KML/KMZ, TSV, XML",,,"United States, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, Wake Island, Barbuda  ",1854-2011,1996,"every 6 minutes",,,,"Section 6.

"Fire Weather Outlooks ","The purpose of the SPC Fire Weather program is to provide a national fire weather guidance product for use by the National Weather Service, as well as other federal, state, and local government agencies. The product is intended to delineate areas of the contiguous U. S. where the pre-existing fuel conditions, combined with forecast weather conditions during the next 8 days will result in a significant threat for wildfires.There are three types of Fire Weather Outlook areas - a Critical Fire Weather Area for Wind and Relative Humidity, an Extremely Critical Fire Weather Area for Extreme Conditions of Wind and Relative Humidity, and a Critical Fire Weather Area for Dry Thunderstorms.The SPC Fire Weather Outlook is comprised of a Day 1 and a Day 2 forecast, in addition to a Day 3-8 forecast. Each forecast period will contain text products along with corresponding graphic products. The Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook is scheduled for issuance at 4:00 AM CST/CDT and is updated at 17Z. The Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook is scheduled for issuance at 10Z and is updated at 20Z. The Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook is scheduled for issuance at 22Z.The Day 1 Outlook covers the 24-hour period from 12Z on the morning of product issuance to 12Z the following morning, with the update covering the 19-hour period from 17Z at issuance to 12Z the following morning. The Day 2 Outlook covers the following 24-hour period out to 48 hours. The Day 3-8 Outlook covers the period of 48 to 192 hours from 12Z on the morning of product issuance.The outlook type depends upon the severity of the forecast weather, antecedent conditions, and climatology relative to the given geographic region. Critical Fire Weather Areas for Wind and Relative Humidity are typically issued when strong winds (>20 mph) and low RH are expected to occur where dried fuels exist. Critical Fire Weather for Dry Thunderstorms are typically issued when widespread or numerous thunderstorms producing little wetting rain (<0.10 in) are expected to occur where dried fuels exist. Extremely Critical Fire Weather Areas for Wind and Relative Humidity are issued when very strong winds and very low RH are expected to occur with very dry fuels. Extremely Critical areas will be rarely issued, similar to the very low frequency of High Risk Convective Outlooks.

"North Pacific Groundfish Diet Data,  1981-2007","Groundfish diet data collected during the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (NOAA/NMFS) groundfish surveys in the eastern Bering Sea, Aleutian Islands, and Gulf of Alaska regions from 1981 through 2007. Diet data is associated with corresponding haul location data. Diet data is described to the lowest practical taxon with the exception of fish and crab prey which are generally described to the species level. These data are stored in an Oracle 11 database and manipulated for presentation via MSAccess07. For presentation purposes, diet data have been grouped into 125 common prey categories. This research proposed to further define and understand the marine ecosystems that involves commercially important groundfish in the Bering Sea, Aleutian Islands and Gulf of Alaska.","Food Habits, Ecosystem Dynamics, Food Web, Ecosystem Modeling diet, trophic dynamics, Aleutian Islands, Bering Sea,

"Great Lakes Surface Environmental Analysis ","The Great Lakes Surface Environmental Analysis (GLSEA2) is a digital map of the Great Lakes surface water temperature and ice cover which is produced daily at the NOAA Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL) in Ann Arbor, Michigan through the NOAA CoastWatch program. The GLSEA is stored as a 1024x1024 pixel map in PNG or ASCII format, suitable for viewing on PCs and workstations with readily available software. The lake surface temperatures are derived from NOAA polar-orbiting satellite imagery obtained through the Great Lakes CoastWatch program. The addition of ice cover information was implemented in early 1999, using data provided by the National Ice Center (NIC). Lake surface temperatures are updated daily with information from the cloud-free portions of the previous day's satellite imagery. If no imagery is available, a smoothing algorithm is applied to the previous day's map. Ice information will then be added, using the most recent Great Lakes Ice Analysis produced by NIC, currently daily during the ice season. GLERL is currently receiving a product suite of an average of 108 enhanced digital images including satellite-derived surface temperature (Fig. 1.1), visible and near-infrared reflectance, brightness temperatures, cloud masks, and satellite/solar zenith angle data from the NOAA/AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer).

"NOAA's Inundation Analysis Tool","Coastal storms and other meteorological phenomenon can have a significant impact on how high water levels rise and how often. The inundation analysis program is extremely beneficial in determining the frequency (or the occurrence of high waters for different elevations above a specified threshold) and duration (or the amount of time that the specified location is inundated by water) of observed high waters (tides). Statistical output from these analyses can be useful in planning marsh restoration activities. Additionally, the analyses have broader applications for the coastal engineering and mapping community, such as, ecosystem management and regional climate change. Since these statistical outputs are station specific, use for evaluating surrounding areas may be limited.ProductsThe data input for this tool is 6-minute water level data time series and the tabulated times and heights of the high tides over a user specified time period, relative to a desired tidal datum or user-specified datum. The data output of this tool provides summary statistics, which includes the number of occurrences of inundation above the threshold (events) and length of duration of inundation of each events above the threshold elevation for a specified time period. In addition to summary statistics, graphical outputs are provided using three plots. The first plot is a histogram of frequency of occurrence relative to the threshold elevation, the second plot is a histogram of the frequency of duration of inundation, and the third plot is an X-Y plot of frequency of elevation versus duration of inundation for each event. Input data time series are presently limited to the verified data from a set of operating and historical tide stations in the NOAA CO-OPS data base.","inundation, analysis, tool, tides, water level, sea level, frequency, duration",12/21/11,"Department of Commerce","User Services",co-ops.userservices@noaa.gov,DOC-6182,public,http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/publications/glossary2.pdf,http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/inundation,"txt, csv",,,"U.S. coastal waters including Alaska and Hawaii, Guam, Puerto Rico","06/30/1854 to present",12/21/11,"Data collected every 6 minutes",,"latitude / longitude",,"Section 6.

"Great Lakes Coastwatch","CoastWatch is a nationwide National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) program within which the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL) functions as the Great Lakes regional node. In this capacity, GLERL obtains, produces, and delivers environmental data and products for near real-time observation of the Great Lakes to support environmental science, decision making, and supporting research. This is achieved by providing access to near real-time and retrospective satellite observations and in-situ Great Lakes data. The goals and objectives of the CoastWatch Great Lakes Program directly support NOAA's statutory responsibilities in estuarine and marine science living marine resource protection, and ecosystem monitoring and management.The CoastWatch node at GLERL provides clients including Federal, state, and local agencies, academic institutions, commercial/industries and the public, both within and outside of the Great Lakes region, with access to near real-time satellite observations and in-situ data for the Great Lakes. CoastWatch data are used in a variety of ways, including near real-time observation and tracking of algal blooms, plumes, ice cover, wind, water intake temperatures at fish hatcheries, two and three dimensional modeling of Great Lakes physical parameters such as wave height and currents damage assessment modeling, research, and educational and recreational activities. In addition, through a cooperative project with Michigan Sea Grant, Great Lakes CoastWatch satellite-derived surface temperature imagery is contoured and made available via Michigan State Sea Grant's web site. Great Lakes CoastWatch data and products benefit riparians as well as commercial and recreational users.GLERL is currently receiving a product suite of 33 enhanced digital images including satellite-derived surface temperature (Fig. 1.1), visible and near-infrared reflectance, brightness temperatures, cloud masks, and satellite/solar zenith angle data from the NOAA/AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) series of satellites as well as GOES (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites) visible, near infrared, and water vapor data. These products are acquired by GLERL from NOAA's National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) on a daily schedule via Internet. In addition, MODIS true color 250m resolution imagery (Fig. 1.2) of each Great Lake (received near real-time from the Space Science and Engineering Center at the University of Wisconsin), in-situ and modeled data, including marine and meteorological observations, buoy observations, water level gauge measurements from NOAA's National Ocean Service, and Great Lakes Surface Environmental Analysis (GLSEA) composite charts (Fig. 1.3), are routinely acquired or produced, stored, and made available to Great Lakes CoastWatch data users. Great Lakes Forecasting system (nowcast and forecast) products are also available to CoastWatch data users. Near real-time AVHRR satellite data for the past 2 weeks are available at GLERL, and access to a retrospective archive that begins in 1990 is available via an Internet link to the NOAA CoastWatch Active Access System at the NESDIS Satellite Active Archive.
