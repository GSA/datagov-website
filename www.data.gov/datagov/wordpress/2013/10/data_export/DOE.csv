"US DOE/NNSA and DoD Response to 2011 Fukushima Incident: Radiological Air Samples","Field Samples are physical media collected during the response which are subsequently analyzed either in a laboratory or in the field using InSitu equipment. Common field samples include air filters and soil samples. Radiochemistry analysis typically reports the presence of specific radionuclides measured as total activity or as either activity/unit of mass or activity/unit of volume, depending upon the sample media. In addition, total beta and total alpha activity may be reported. Currently, air filter and soil sample analysis results may be downloaded through the data repository. Both data sets are similar; they contain a number of columns describing the collected sample as well as the results of radiochemical analysis.

"US DOE/NNSA Response to 2011 Fukushima Incident: Instrument Samples (InSitu Measurements","Field Samples are physical media collected during the response which are subsequently analyzed either in a laboratory or in the field using InSitu equipment. Common field samples include air filters and soil samples. Radiochemistry analysis typically reports the presence of specific radionuclides measured as total activity or as either activity/unit of mass or activity/unit of volume, depending upon the sample media. In addition, total beta and total alpha activity may be reported. Currently, air filter and soil sample analysis results may be downloaded through the data repository. Both data sets are similar; they contain a number of columns describing the collected sample as well as the results of radiochemical analysis. In addition, there are a number of special fields that are specific to a given sample type; e.g. Air Filters specify the filter type and total volume, while soil samples specify the sample weight. For convenience, the sample information and subsequent analysis has been flattened into a simple tabular format. Consequently, if a sample has multiple analysis results the sample collection values will be repeated through the set; e.g. sample ID#, barcode, latitude/longitude, collection date etc. To be included in the data repository, a given sample must meet the following criteria: has a valid latitude, longitude, and collection date; has been sent to a laboratory for analysis, or had analysis performed in the field; has at least one valid analysis result with a reportable unit, nuclide, and activity which has been validated by an authorized laboratory staff member.  These results represent raw data that have been calibrated  to physical units and validated.

"SciTech Connect","""SciTech Connect is a portal to free, publicly-available DOE-sponsored R&D results including technical reports, bibliographic citations, journal articles, conference papers, books, multimedia and data information. SciTech Connect is a consolidation of two core DOE search engines, the Information Bridge and the Energy Citations Database. SciTech Connect incorporates all of the R&D information from these two products into one search interface. SciTech Connect was developed by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI) to increase access to science, technology, and engineering research information from DOE and its predecessor agencies.SciTech Connect contains all the full-text documents and citations previously found in Information Bridge and Energy Citations Database. Thus, SciTech Connect contains over sixty-five years of energy-related citations created and/or collected by OSTI. SciTech Connect includes technical reports, bibliographic citations, journal articles, conference papers, books, multimedia, and data information sponsored by DOE through a grant, contract, cooperative agreement, or similar type of funding mechanism from the 1940s to today. This collection continues to grow as new scientific and technical information resulting from DOE research becomes available. There are over 2.5 million citations, including citations to 1.4 million journal articles, 364,000 of which have digital object identifiers (DOIs) linking to full-text articles on publishers' websites. SciTech Connect also has over 313,000 full-text DOE sponsored STI reports; most of these are post-1991, but close to 85,000 of the reports were published prior to 1990.The SciTech Connect Basic Search utilizes a semantic search technique called keyword-to-concept mapping.

"DOE R&D Accomplishments ","DOE R&D Accomplishments is a publicly-available central forum for information about the outcomes of past DOE-sponsored or generated research and development. The outcomes featured have had significant economic impact, have improved people's lives, or have been widely recognized as a remarkable advance in science. An R&D accomplishment is the outcome of past research whose benefits are being realized now. It may describe the results of decades of R&D or a one-time breakthrough by an individual researcher. The core of the site is the DOE R&D Accomplishments Database, consisting of searchable electronic documents, with bibliographic citations, that report accomplishments from the Department of Energy, DOE contractor facilities, and DOE predecessors: the Manhattan Project, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), and the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA). Complementing the database are Feature Topic pages, Laureates, Interesting Insights, and Snapshots. Featured Topic pages spotlight an individual scientist or an area of research. Laureate information includes names, date, and type (Nobel or Fermi).  Interesting insights provides a unique view of DOE and predecessor agency research and developments.  Snapshots provide quick pictures, introductions, overviews, or synopses of DOE accomplishments.","achievements, AEC, Atomic Energy Commission, Department of Energy, discoveries,DOE R&D, economic impact, economic investments, Energy Research and Development Administration, Enrico Fermi Award, ERDA, impacts, innovation, inventions, legacy, Nobel Laureates, Nobel Prize winners, Office of Scientific and Technical Information, OSTI, outcomes, R&D accomplishments, reports, research accomplishments, research and development, research and development accomplishments, research investments, research results, snapshots, success stories",irregular,"Department of Energy","Office of Scientific and Technical Information",Accomplishments@osti.gov,DOE-30081,public,,http://www.osti.gov/accomplishments/,txt,,,n/a,n/a,01/01/2005,n/a,,,,"Section 16.
