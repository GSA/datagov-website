Market quotations are obtained at approximately 3:30 PM each business day by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The Bank Discount rate is the rate at which a Bill is quoted in the secondary market and is based on the par value, amount of the discount and a 360-day year. The Coupon Equivalent, also called the Bond Equivalent, or the Investment Yield, is the bill's yield based on the purchase price, discount, and a 365- or 366-day year.

On June 1, 2004, Treasury discontinued the ""LT>25"" average due to a dearth of eligible bonds. In place of the ""LT>25"" average, Treasury published the Treasury 20-year Constant Maturity rate on this page along with an extrapolation factor that was added to the 20-year Constant Maturity to obtain an estimate for a theoretical 30-year rate. On February 9, 2006, Treasury reintroduced the 30-year constant maturity and is no longer publishing the extrapolation factor.","LT, composite, treasury, extrapolation, factor, date, average",Monthly,"Department of the Treasury","Office of the Chief Information Officer, Departmental Offices",digital@treasury.gov,TREAS-414,public,http://www.treasury.gov/offices/domestic-finance/debt-management/interest-rate/ltcompositeindex.shtml,http://www.treas.gov/offices/domestic-finance/debt-management/interest-rate/ltcompositeindex_historical.xml,XML,,,Global,"2000 - Current year","January 2000",Monthly,,National,,"Section 9.
