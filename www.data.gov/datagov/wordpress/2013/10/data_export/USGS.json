The Energy Geochemistry Data Base (EGDB) contains chemical analysis data for crude oil, natural gas, coal, water, and rock samples analyzed by the USGS Energy Resources Team's Geochemistry Laboratory, or by contracted-service laboratories. Data was also obtained from the literature and unpublished public domain sources. The sample types included are primarily rock, coal, oil, and gas. This information is used by the USGS for worldwide energy resource assessments and is periodically released to the public. Analytical data within the EGDB includes Rock-Eval pyrolysis, organic mass spectrometry, vitrinite reflectance, gas chromatography, stable carbon isotopes, inductively coupled plasma, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, mercury analysis and a number of other related geochemistry analyses that, in some instances, predate the EGDB. Throughout the years the Energy Program scientists have utilized these data to not only develop an understanding of the physical and geochemical processes responsible for hydrocarbon formation. but also as a tool to assess the oil and gas potential for sedimentary basins in both national and international settings.","keyword":"Oil, Gas, Coal, Coal Quality, Chemistry, Geochemistry, Rock-Eval pyrolysis, organic mass spectrometry, vitrinite reflectance, gas chromatography, stable carbon isotopes, inductively coupled plasma, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, mercury analysis","modified":"7\/1\/2009","publisher":"Department of the Interior","person":"Chris Skinner","mbox":"cskinner@usgs.gov","identifier":"DOI-4011","accessLevel":"public","dataDictionary":"http:\/\/energy.cr.usgs.gov\/prov\/og\/doc.htm","accessURL":"http:\/\/energy.cr.usgs.gov\/prov\/og\/tabular\/EGDB_07292009.zip","format":"Microsoft Access database, zip compressed","webService":"","license":"","spatial":"World","temporal":"1989-2009","issued":"1\/1\/1989","accrualPeriodicity":"Irregular","language":"","granularity":"latitude\/longitude provided for each sample","dataQuality":"","theme":"Section 18.

The real-time information generally is updated on an hourly basis. WaterWatch provides streamgage-based maps that show the location of more than 3,000 long-term (30 years or more) USGS streamgages; use colors to represent streamflow conditions compared to historical streamflow; feature a point-and-click interface allowing users to retrieve graphs of stream stage (water elevation) and flow; and highlight locations where extreme hydrologic events, such as floods and droughts, are occurring. \r\rThe streamgage-based maps show streamflow conditions for real-time, average daily, and 7-day average streamflow. The real-time streamflow maps highlight flood and high flow conditions. The 7-day average streamflow maps highlight below-normal and drought conditions. \r\rWaterWatch also provides hydrologic unit code (HUC) maps. HUC-based maps are derived from the streamgage-based maps and illustrate streamflow conditions in hydrologic regions. These maps show average streamflow conditions for 1-, 7-, 14-, and 28-day periods, and for monthly average streamflow; highlight regions of low flow or hydrologic drought; and provide historical runoff and streamflow conditions beginning in 1901.\r\rWaterWatch summarizes streamflow conditions in a region (state or hydrologic unit) in terms of the long-term typical condition at streamgages in the region. Summary tables are provided along with time-series plots that depict variations through time.

We present a simple but robust method that uses remotely sensed thermal data and model-assimilated weather fields to produce ET for the contiguous United States (CONUS) at monthly and seasonal time scales. The method is based on the Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEB) model which is now parameterized for operational applications, renamed as SSEBop. The innovative aspect of the SSEBop is that it uses pre-defined, boundary conditions that are unique to each pixel for the \"hot\" and \"cold\" reference conditions. The SSEBop model was used for computing ET for 12 years (2000-2011) using the MODIS and Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) data streams. SSEPop ET results compared reasonably well with monthly eddy covariance ET data explaining 64% of the observed variability across diverse ecosystems in the CONUS during 2005. Twelve annual ET anomalies (2000-2011) depicted the spatial extent and severity of the commonly known drought years in the CONUS. More research is required to improve the representation of the pre-defined boundary conditions in complex terrain at small spatial scales. SSEBop model was found to be a promising approach to conduct water use studies in the CONUS, with a similar opportunity in other parts of the world. The approach can also be applied with other thermal sensors such as Landsat.","keyword":"Africa, evapotranspiration, energy balance, drought, remote sensing, water use","modified":"Continuously, every 8 days","publisher":"Department of the Interior","person":"James Rowland","mbox":"rowland@usgs.gov","identifier":"DOI-26241","accessLevel":"public","dataDictionary":"http:\/\/eros.usgs.gov\/refbase\/show.php?record=25662","accessURL":"http:\/\/earlywarning.usgs.gov\/fews\/africa\/index.php","format":"PDF,PNG","webService":"","license":"","spatial":"Africa","temporal":"2001 to present","issued":"04\/01\/2013","accrualPeriodicity":"Every 8 days","language":"","granularity":"Evapotranspiration per square kilometer","dataQuality":"","theme":"Section 17.

Geological Survey Central Energy Resources Science Center's Organic Geochemistry Laboratory is a research laboratory devoted to the investigation of the origin and occurrence of organic fossil fuels. Although it is not a service laboratory, many of the analytical results from the laboratory could prove useful in future petroleum geological and geochemical studies. In order to archive these results, the USGS developed an Alaskan Organic Geochemical Data Base (AOGDB) in 1978 to house the data from not only the USGS's involvement in the project, but also the data accumulated from a variety of sub-contracting laboratories. The accumulated data resided in a flat text file entitled \"PGS\" and was maintained by Petroleum Information Corporation. The information provided here is a distillation of ASCII tables that originated in the master flat files of the relational AOGDB files.","keyword":"Alaska, Organic Geochemistry, Organic Geochemistry Data of Alaska, Energy, Oil and Gas Investigations, USGS, USGS DDS-59, Geology and Exploration of the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska","modified":"01\/01\/2000","publisher":"Department of the Interior","person":"Raymond Obuch","mbox":"obuch@usgs.gov","identifier":"DOI-35441","accessLevel":"public","dataDictionary":"http:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/dds\/dds-059\/dbdoc.htm","accessURL":["http:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/dds\/dds-059\/dbtables.htm","http:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/dds\/dds-059\/dwnshape.htm","http:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/dds\/dds-059\/#Data Download..."],"format":["CSV\/TXT","Shapefile","KML\/KMZ"],"webService":"","license":"","spatial":"State of Alaska","temporal":"1974-1982","issued":"01\/01\/2000","accrualPeriodicity":"routinely","language":"","granularity":"State of Alaska","dataQuality":"","theme":"Section 19.
