"USGS Energy Geochemistry Database","Since January of 1989, the U.S Geological Survey (USGS) Energy Resources Program Geochemistry Laboratory Data Base has grown to contain the analytical data for over 200,000 samples worldwide. The Energy Geochemistry Data Base (EGDB) contains chemical analysis data for crude oil, natural gas, coal, water, and rock samples analyzed by the USGS Energy Resources Team's Geochemistry Laboratory, or by contracted-service laboratories. Data was also obtained from the literature and unpublished public domain sources. The sample types included are primarily rock, coal, oil, and gas. This information is used by the USGS for worldwide energy resource assessments and is periodically released to the public. Analytical data within the EGDB includes Rock-Eval pyrolysis, organic mass spectrometry, vitrinite reflectance, gas chromatography, stable carbon isotopes, inductively coupled plasma, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, mercury analysis and a number of other related geochemistry analyses that, in some instances, predate the EGDB. Throughout the years the Energy Program scientists have utilized these data to not only develop an understanding of the physical and geochemical processes responsible for hydrocarbon formation. but also as a tool to assess the oil and gas potential for sedimentary basins in both national and international settings.","Oil, Gas, Coal, Coal Quality, Chemistry, Geochemistry, Rock-Eval pyrolysis, organic mass spectrometry, vitrinite reflectance, gas chromatography, stable carbon isotopes, inductively coupled plasma, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, mercury analysis",7/1/2009,"Department of the Interior","Chris Skinner",cskinner@usgs.gov,DOI-4011,public,http://energy.cr.usgs.gov/prov/og/doc.htm,http://energy.cr.usgs.gov/prov/og/tabular/EGDB_07292009.zip,"Microsoft Access database, zip compressed",,,World,1989-2009,1/1/1989,Irregular,,"latitude/longitude provided for each sample",,"Section 18.

"WaterWatch -- Current Water Resources Conditions","WaterWatch (http://waterwatch.usgs.gov) is a U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) World Wide Web site that displays maps, graphs, and tables describing real-time, recent, and past streamflow conditions for the United States. The real-time information generally is updated on an hourly basis. WaterWatch provides streamgage-based maps that show the location of more than 3,000 long-term (30 years or more) USGS streamgages; use colors to represent streamflow conditions compared to historical streamflow; feature a point-and-click interface allowing users to retrieve graphs of stream stage (water elevation) and flow; and highlight locations where extreme hydrologic events, such as floods and droughts, are occurring. The streamgage-based maps show streamflow conditions for real-time, average daily, and 7-day average streamflow. The real-time streamflow maps highlight flood and high flow conditions. The 7-day average streamflow maps highlight below-normal and drought conditions. WaterWatch also provides hydrologic unit code (HUC) maps. HUC-based maps are derived from the streamgage-based maps and illustrate streamflow conditions in hydrologic regions. These maps show average streamflow conditions for 1-, 7-, 14-, and 28-day periods, and for monthly average streamflow; highlight regions of low flow or hydrologic drought; and provide historical runoff and streamflow conditions beginning in 1901.WaterWatch summarizes streamflow conditions in a region (state or hydrologic unit) in terms of the long-term typical condition at streamgages in the region. Summary tables are provided along with time-series plots that depict variations through time. WaterWatch also includes tables of current streamflow information and locations of flooding. ","Streamflow, floods, droughts, runoff, water, maps, statistics, United States, Water Resources Regions, Annual Summaries",3/1/2011,"Department of the Interior","Harry Lins",hlins@usgs.gov,DOI-4515,public,http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2008/3031/,http://waterwatch.usgs.gov/new/,"Web Browser Display",,,"United States including Puerto Rico","6/24/1999 to present on a daily basis",6/24/1999,Hourly,,"Streamgage location (latitude-longitude pair)",,"Section 6.

"2010-2011 Hydrologic Survey of Franklin D. Roosevelt Reservoir (Lake Roosevelt)","Reclamation's survey of Franklin D. Roosevelt Reservoir (Lake Roosevelt) began in October 2010 and continued during
portions of June, July, and August of 2011. The primary purpose was to develop detailed digital reservoir topography. The
underwater survey was conducted between water surface elevation 1,260 and spilling elevation 1,290 (project datum in feet).
This study measured the project vertical datum around 2.5 feet lower than the North American Vertical Datum of 1988
(NAVD88). The generated reservoir topography elevations were tied to NAVD88. The surface area and volume computations
from the topography were shifted -2.5 feet to match the Grand Coulee project's vertical datum. The underwater survey used
sonic depth recording equipment interfaced with real-time global positioning systems that provided continuous sounding
positions throughout the underwater portion of the reservoir covered by the survey vessels. The 2010-11 reservoir topography
was generated by importing digital coverages from 1974 aerial photogrammetry, 2007 bathymetry of the upper reservoir, and
2009-10 Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) surveys combined with the 2010-11 bathymetric data. The 2010-11 bathymetric
data was the first detailed bottom information of the deeper portions of Lake Roosevelt, below elevation 1,160.
As of August 2011, at reservoir water surface elevation 1,290.0, the surface area was 81,991 acres with a total capacity of
9,715,346 acre-feet and an active capacity, between elevation 1,208.0 and 1,290.0, of 5,349,560 acre-feet.","Lake Roosevelt , sedimentation survey , hydrologic survey , Grand Coulee Dam , reservoir area , reservoir capacity , global positioning system , GPS , sounders , contour RTK GPS , mutlibeam , reservoir topography",2012,"Department of the Interior","James Nagode",JBNagode@usbr.gov,DOI-9271,public,http://www.usbr.gov/pmts/sediment/projects/ReservoirSurveys/Reports/Lake%20Roosevelt%20Reservoir%20Survey%202010-11.pdf,http://www.usbr.gov/pmts/sediment/projects/ReservoirSurveys/Data/Lake%20Roosevelt%20Reservoir%20Survey%202010-11.gdb_93.gdb.zip,"File Geo-database (.gdb)",,,"Lake Roosevelt, Washington, USA","October 2010, June through August 2011.",2012,one-time,,"longitude/latitude pair",,"Section 6.

conducted between lake elevation 4626 (feet) and 4629 (project datum), used sonic depth recording equipment interfaced with a global positioning system (GPS) that gave continuous sounding positions throughout the underwater portions of the reservoir covered by the survey vessel. In January 2005, a GPS land survey was conducted on a small portion of the upper reach of the reservoir. The above-water topography was determined by digitizing reservoir contours from the U.S. Geological Survey quadrangle (USGS quad) maps. The new topographic map of Glendo Reservoir was developed from the digitized USGS quad contours (adjusted in the upper reach using the January 2005 data) and the 2003 underwater data. Due to the lack of complete above water data, this study assumed no change since the 1972 reservoir resurvey from elevation 4640 and above.","Glendo Reservoir , Glendo Dam , sedimentation survey , hydrologic survey , sonar , reservoir area , reservoir capacity , global positioning system , GPS , contour area , reservoir topography",2012,"Department of the Interior","James Nagode",JBNagode@usbr.gov,DOI-9281,public,http://www.usbr.gov/pmts/sediment/projects/ReservoirSurveys/Reports/Glendo%20Reservoir%202003%20Sedimentation%20Survey.pdf,http://www.usbr.gov/pmts/sediment/projects/ReservoirSurveys/Data/Glendo%20Sedimentation%20Survey%202003.gdb.zip,"File Geo-database (.gdb)",,,"Glendo Reservoir, Wyoming, USA","""May and July of 2003, January 2005""",2012,one-time,,"longitude/latitude pair",,"Section 6.

"2001 Hydrologic Survey of Lake Estes","The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) surveyed Lake Estes in August of 2001 to develop a topographic map and compute a present storage-elevation relationship (area-capacity tables). The data were used to calculate reservoir capacity lost due tosediment accumulation since dam closure in November of 1948.  The underwater survey was conducted between lake elevation and project datum.  The underwater survey used sonic depth recording equipment interfaced with a global positioning system (GPS) that gave continous sounding positions throughout the underwater. portions of the reservoir covered by the survey vessel.  The above-water topography was determined by digitizing the developed contour lines from the U.S. Geological Survey quadrangle maps of the reservoir area.  The new topographic map of Lake Estes was developed from the combined digitized USGS quadrangle contours and August 2001 underwater measured topography.  This study assumed no change from elevation 7470.0 feet and above.","Lake Estes, sedimentation survey, hydrologic survey, sonar, reservoir area, reservoir capacity, global positioning system, GPS, contour area, reservoir topography","""2012""","Department of the Interior","James Nagode",JBNagode@usbr.gov,DOI-11111,public,http://www.usbr.gov/pmts/sediment/projects/ReservoirSurveys/Reports/Lake%20Estes%202001%20Survey.pdf,http://www.usbr.gov/pmts/sediment/projects/ReservoirSurveys/Data/Lake%20Estes%202001%20Survey.gdb.zip,"File Geo-database (.gdb)",,,"Lake Estes, Colorado, USA","August 2001","""2012""",one-time,,"longitude/latitude pair",,"Section 18.

"2007 Hydrologic and Sedimentation Survey of Altus Reservoir","Reclamation surveyed Altus Reservoir in November 2006, June 2007, and February 2008 to develop updated reservoir topography and compute the present storage-elevation relationship (area -capacity tables).  The underwater survey conducted between water surface elevations 1,559.2 and 1,559.5 (feet), used sonic depth recording equipment interfaced with a real-time kinematic (RTK) global positioning system (GPS) that provided continuous sounding positions throughout the underwater portion of the reservoir covered by the survey vessel.  The above-water topography was obtained by digitizing reservoir contour lines from the U.S. Geological Survey quadrangle (USGS quad) maps of the reservoir area and adjusting them with the limited RTK GPS land survey points collected in November 2006 and February 2008.  The RTK GPS and USGS quad contour data were also used to develop contours where boat access was not possible due to thick vegetation and shallow water conditions.  This study assumed no change since the 1967 survey at 1,565 and above.  The surface areas and resulting capacity data from elevation 1,559 to 1,565 were computed by linear interpolation.  Accurate mapping of the upper reservoir contours would require aerial data collection when the vegetation foliage was minimal and during low reservoir conditions.","Altus Reservoir , W.C.

"Actual Evaportranspiration - Africa","The increasing availability of multi-scale remotely sensed data and global weather datasets is allowing the estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) at multiple scales. We present a simple but robust method that uses remotely sensed thermal data and model-assimilated weather fields to produce ET for the contiguous United States (CONUS) at monthly and seasonal time scales. The method is based on the Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEB) model which is now parameterized for operational applications, renamed as SSEBop. The innovative aspect of the SSEBop is that it uses pre-defined, boundary conditions that are unique to each pixel for the ""hot"" and ""cold"" reference conditions. The SSEBop model was used for computing ET for 12 years (2000-2011) using the MODIS and Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) data streams. SSEPop ET results compared reasonably well with monthly eddy covariance ET data explaining 64% of the observed variability across diverse ecosystems in the CONUS during 2005. Twelve annual ET anomalies (2000-2011) depicted the spatial extent and severity of the commonly known drought years in the CONUS. More research is required to improve the representation of the pre-defined boundary conditions in complex terrain at small spatial scales. SSEBop model was found to be a promising approach to conduct water use studies in the CONUS, with a similar opportunity in other parts of the world. The approach can also be applied with other thermal sensors such as Landsat.","Africa, evapotranspiration, energy balance, drought, remote sensing, water use","Continuously, every 8 days","Department of the Interior","James Rowland",rowland@usgs.gov,DOI-26241,public,http://eros.usgs.gov/refbase/show.php?record=25662,http://earlywarning.usgs.gov/fews/africa/index.php,"PDF,PNG",,,Africa,"2001 to present",04/01/2013,"Every 8 days",,"Evapotranspiration per square kilometer",,"Section 17.

"Folsom Lake 2005 Sedimentation Survey","The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) surveyed Folsom Lake in the fall of 2005 via an interagency agreement with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps of Engineers). The extensive surveys developed topographic imagery to study Folsom Dam, the wing and auxiliary dams, and the eight dikes that form Folsom Lake. The underwater survey was conducted from September 9 through 22, 2005 between lake elevations 437 and 441 feet (project datum). The underwater survey used sonic depth recording equipment interfaced with a global positioning system (GPS) that gave continuous sounding positions throughout the underwater portions of the reservoir covered by the survey vessel. The above-water topography was developed by aerial photography under contract with Reclamation. The main body of the reservoir was flown on October 20, 2005 near reservoir elevation 430.2 (NAVD88-05) and high accuracy data was flown on 10/31/2005 near reservoir elevation 427.1 (NAVD88-05). The 2005 topographic maps were developed from the combined data sets. All digital topographic images for these studies were tied to vertical datum NAVD88-05. For purpose of computing updated area and capacity tables, the topographic elevations were shifted 2.34 feet to match the project vertical elevations. The bathymetric survey measured a minimum elevation of 190. Lake contour surface areas were developed from elevation 490.0 and below.
As of September 2005, at water surface elevation 466.0, the surface area was 11,140 acres with a total capacity of 966,823 acre-feet. Since initial closure in 1955, about 43,407 acre-feet of volume loss was measured by the 2005 survey.","Folsom Lake, Folsom Reservoir, Folsom Dam, American River, sedimentation survey , hydrologic survey , sonar , reservoir area , reservoir capacity , global positioning system , GPS , contour area , reservoir topography",2013,"Department of the Interior","James Nagode",JBNagode@usbr.gov,DOI-33631,public,http://www.usbr.gov/pmts/sediment/projects/ReservoirSurveys/Reports/Folsom%20Lake%202005%20Sedimentation%20Survey.pdf,http://www.usbr.gov/pmts/sediment/projects/ReservoirSurveys/Data/Folsom%20Lake%202005%20Sedimentation%20Survey.gdb.zip,"File Geo-database (.gdb)",,,"Folsom Lake, California, USA","September 9 thru September 22, 2005",2013,one-time,,"longitude/latitude pair",,"Section 1.

"Organic Geochemistry Data of Alaska DDS-59 Version 1.0","The U. S. Geological Survey Central Energy Resources Science Center's Organic Geochemistry Laboratory is a research laboratory devoted to the investigation of the origin and occurrence of organic fossil fuels. Although it is not a service laboratory, many of the analytical results from the laboratory could prove useful in future petroleum geological and geochemical studies. In order to archive these results, the USGS developed an Alaskan Organic Geochemical Data Base (AOGDB) in 1978 to house the data from not only the USGS's involvement in the project, but also the data accumulated from a variety of sub-contracting laboratories. The accumulated data resided in a flat text file entitled ""PGS"" and was maintained by Petroleum Information Corporation. The information provided here is a distillation of ASCII tables that originated in the master flat files of the relational AOGDB files.","Alaska, Organic Geochemistry, Organic Geochemistry Data of Alaska, Energy, Oil and Gas Investigations, USGS, USGS DDS-59, Geology and Exploration of the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska",01/01/2000,"Department of the Interior","Raymond Obuch",obuch@usgs.gov,DOI-35441,public,http://pubs.usgs.gov/dds/dds-059/dbdoc.htm,Array,Array,,,"State of Alaska",1974-1982,01/01/2000,routinely,,"State of Alaska",,"Section 19.
