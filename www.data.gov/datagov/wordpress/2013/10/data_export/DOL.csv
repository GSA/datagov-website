"OSHA Gulf Oil Spill Sampling Data for Assessing Worker Exposures","Following its sampling plan, OSHA industrial hygienists are monitoring workers engaged in the oil spill clean up in the Gulf of Mexico for exposure to hazardous chemicals and conditions.  These data tables provide sample results for chemicals, noise, and heat stress index measurements.  Samples to assess airborne concentrations of oil, weathered oil, oil dispersants, cleaning agents and other materials as identified are taken. When evaluating worker exposure, direct reading instruments and shift-long sampling is performed in the actual breathing zone of workers.   OSHA has also sampled areas that are periodically frequented by workers but the samples are not taken from the breathing zone of workers.  Finally, OSHA has sampled directly over tar balls, inside bags containing contaminated materials, and other locations that do not represent worker exposure but provide information on the types of chemicals that may be coming off contaminated materials.","Worker Exposures, Gulf Oil Spill, Sampling Data, Laboratory Analysis Results, Direct Reading Results, Noise monitoring Results, Chemical Exposures, Chemical Sampling",09/09/2010,"Department of Labor","Keith Motley",motley.keith@dol.gov,DOL-3979,public,http://www.osha.gov/oilspills/oil_sltc_bysite.html,http://www.osha.gov/oilspills/index_sampling.html,TXT/CSV,,No,"Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida","4/2/10 - 10/30/10",04/10/2010,daily,,"Beach, Bayou, Ship, longitude/latitude",,"Section 12.

"Office of Foreign Labor Certification Disclosure Data","This page allows the public to access the latest quarterly and annual disclosure data in easily accessible formats for the purpose of performing in-depth longitudinal research and analysis. OFLC case disclosure data are available for download on a Federal Fiscal Year cycle covering the October 1 through September 30 period in Microsoft Access (mdb) file format. Select data fields for each case record are extracted from foreign labor certification application tables within OFLC case management systems based on the most recent date a determination decision was issued. Each data set is cumulative, containing unique records identified by the applicable OFLC case number, and any noticeable typographical or other data anomalies may be due to internal data entry or other external customer errors in completing the application form. 

Important Notice: Employer-specific case information that appears on FLCDataCenter.com was provided to ETA by employers who submitted foreign labor certification applications. These are not employer responses to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Occupational Employment Statistics (BLS-OES) survey. The BLS-OES program provides estimates used to assist in setting the wage levels in the FLC wage library. However, the BLS does not provide ETA with the wage rates reported to BLS by individual businesses. The identity of respondents and the information that they report to BLS is kept in strict confidence in accordance with BLS Data Integrity Guidelines and with the Confidentiality Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act (CIPSEA) of 2002.

Latest Quarterly Updates
Beginning October 1, 2010 (FY 2011), OFLC is posting cumulative quarterly case disclosure data covering the permanent and temporary labor certification programs as well as the new prevailing wage program.
The following case disclosure files cover determination decisions issued between October 1 and December 31, 2010. A small percentage of determination decisions are subject to change in subsequent quarterly releases due to appeal or redetermination decisions on employer applications.","Foreign Labor Certification, Case Disclosure, OFLC, PERM, H-2A, H-2B, H-1B, Prevailing Wage",02/14/2011,"Department of Labor","Rob Jordan",jordan.rob@dol.gov,DOL-4706,public,http://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/quarterlydata.cfm,http://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/quarterlydata.cfm,.mdb,,,U.S.A.,"FY 2008 - FY 2011",02/14/2011,"Continuous / Hourly",,"City and Zip Code",,"Section 12.

Data for the 2010 Fiscal Year is extracted from the iCert system.
Data for the 2009 Fiscal Year is extracted from the iCert system and the eFile system
Prior to the 2009 Fiscal Year employers have had the option to file H-1B applications via the LCA E-File online system or via the automated fax system.  H-1B data is available for both systems as separate files.  Over 90 percent of H-1B applications were e-filed in FY 2004. 
The data are available for download by fiscal year (October to September) in Microsoft Access or comma delimited text format.  To speed up the download process the data are in ZIP files, however the files are still very large, and can take 2 hours or more to download using a dial-up connection.
