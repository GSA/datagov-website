[{"title":"Next Generation Radar (NEXRAD) Locations","description":"This geospatial rendering of weather radar sites gives access to an historical archive of Terminal Doppler Weather Radar data and is used primarily for research purposes. The archived data includes base data and derived products of the National Weather Service (NWS) Weather Surveillance Radar 88 Doppler (WSR-88D) next generation (NEXRAD) weather radar.  Weather radar detects the three meteorological base data quantities: reflectivity, mean radial velocity, and spectrum width.  From these quantities, computer processing generates numerous meteorological analysis products for forecasts, archiving and dissemination.  There are 159 operational  NEXRAD radar systems deployed throughout the United States and at selected overseas locations.  At the Radar Operations Center (ROC) in Norman OK, personnel from the NWS, Air Force, Navy, and FAA use this distributed weather radar system to collect the data needed to warn of impending severe weather and possible flash floods; support air traffic safety and assist in the management of air traffic flow control; facilitate resource protection at military bases; and optimize the management of water, agriculture, forest, and snow removal.  This data set is jointly owned by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Federal Aviation Administration, and Department of Defense.","keyword":"NEXRAD, WSR-88D, weather, radar, precipitation, tornado, hurricane, flood, reflectivity, rainrate, historical archive, radar scans, storm events, federal data download, federal datasets, reflectivity, mean radial velocity, spectrum","modified":"Irregular as needed","publisher":"Department of Commerce","person":"Stephen Del Greco, Branch Chief - Operations Branch, Remote Sensing and Applications Division, NOAA's National Climatic Data Center 828-271-4281","mbox":"","identifier":"DOC-4","accessLevel":"public","dataDictionary":"http:\/\/www.ncdc.noaa.gov\/oa\/radar\/radarproducts.html","accessURL":"http:\/\/www.ncdc.noaa.gov\/oa\/radar\/nexrad.kmz","format":"KML\/KMZ","webService":"","license":"","spatial":"U.S., Puerto Rico, South Korea","temporal":"1991 to present","issued":"1991","accrualPeriodicity":"Between 4 and 10 minutes","language":"","granularity":"longitude\/latitude","dataQuality":"","theme":"Section 6.

The observations have been collected with the support of the Atmospheric Circulation Reconstructions over the Earth initiative, and working groups of GCOS and WCRP. The Project uses a recently-developed Ensemble Filter data assimilation method which directly yields each six-hourly analysis as the most likely state of the global atmosphere, and also estimates uncertainty in that analysis.  This dataset will provide the first estimates of global tropospheric and stratospheric variability spanning 1871 to present at six-hourly resolution (V2). In Version 2, data files are also produced for daily and monthly values of the variables. The first version has global coverage spanning 1908-1958, and two degree longitude-latitude horizontal resolution (V1).\r","keyword":"pressure, MSL, humidity, SST, sea ice, global, upper-level winds, ozone, meridional winds, zonal winds, u-wind, v-wind, geopotential height,  temperature, solar radiation,  convection, potential energy, gravity wave, cloud liquid, omega,  vertical velocity,  water, precipitable water,  cloud microphysics, carbon dioxide,  volcano, aerosol, grids, soil moisture, soil temperature, CAPE, CIN, albedo, ground heat, planetary boundary height, ice concentration, ice thickness, latent heat flux, potential evaporation, runoff, sensible heat, snow depth, snow cover, cloud cover, transpiration, momentum flux, wspd ","modified":"2010","publisher":"Department of Commerce","person":"NOAA\/ESRL PSD Data Management","mbox":"cathy.smith@noaa.gov","identifier":"DOC-2528","accessLevel":"public","dataDictionary":"http:\/\/www.esrl.noaa.gov\/psd\/data\/gridded\/data.20thC_ReanV2.html","accessURL":"ftp:\/\/ftp.cdc.noaa.gov\/Datasets\/20thC_ReanV2\/","format":"netcdf3","webService":"","license":"","spatial":"Global","temporal":"1871-2008","issued":"12\/31\/2008","accrualPeriodicity":"Hourly, Daily, Monthly ","language":"","granularity":"output:  grid (2x2) ","dataQuality":"","theme":"Section 6.

This model is used to measure the movement of surface currents over time, as well as the movement of what is in or on the water.  Ocean surface currents affect organisms suspended in the water column - such as fish eggs, small larvae, and plankton - and may affect their survival by determining their location after a few months of drift.  Even swimming or migrating fish or mammals may have their destinations significantly offset by currents or the annual variability of currents.  OSCURS has gained visibility as an accidental debris tracker to analyze accidental but fortuitous at-sea events beyond the scale of normal oceanographic science.

A reanalysis dataset typically extends over several decades or longer, and covers the entire globe from the Earth's surface to well above the stratosphere.  Reanalysis products are used extensively in climate research and services, including for monitoring and comparing current climate conditions with those of the past, identifying the causes of climate variations and change, and preparing climate predictions. Recently, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Aeronautical and Space Administration (NASA), European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), and Japanese Meterological Agency (JMA) have produced new reanalysis datasets that, in total, span 1871 to present. It is crucial to our scientific understanding of climate variability and change that these new datasets be validated and compared with each other and with the underlying observations. International working groups of the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS, the climate element of the Global Earth Observing System of Systems) and the World Climate Research Program, and the Atmospheric Circulation Reconstruction over the Earth (ACRE) initiative need a community portal to exchange quickly and disseminate publicly results of such intercomparisons. NOAA's own mission and strategic goals regarding reanalyzes, as well as its leading role in the US Global Change Research Program, GCOS, WCRP, and ACRE, make NOAA the logical and obvious choice to serve a website dedicated to improving understanding of the international reanalysis datasets, including those recently generated by NOAA, the 20th Century Reanalysis and Climate Forecast System Reanalysis.  The new website \"reanalyses.org\" will serve as a central portal for Reanalysis Intercomparison and Observations (RIO) by NOAA, NASA, ECMWF, JMA, and national and international scientists. The website should be outside the \"noaa.gov\" domain. It will help NOAA and the international scientific community to improve the climate science and services that reanalyzes underpin.\r\rNOAA strategic plans and US Global Climate Research Program plans to which NOAA Office of Atmospheric Research and the new NOAA Climate Service will respond specifically call for advances in understanding reanalysis datasets. The RIO will coordinate with the NOAA Climate Services portal to make the intercomparison and observation documentation public. \r \r","keyword":"pressure, MSL, humidity, SST, sea ice, global, upper-level winds, ozone, meridional winds, zonal winds, u-wind, v-wind, geopotential height,  temperature, solar radiation,  convection, potential energy, gravity wave, cloud liquid, omega,  vertical velocity,  water, precipitable water,  cloud microphysics, carbon dioxide,  volcano, aerosol, grids, soil moisture, soil temperature, CAPE, CIN, albedo, ground heat, planetary boundary height, ice concentration, ice thickness, latent heat flux, potential evaporation, runoff, sensible heat, snow depth, snow cover, cloud cover, transpiration, momentum flux, wspd, hydrological, dewpoint, precipitation, radiance, TOVS, SSM\/I, ERS, ATOVS, GATE, FGGE, ALPEX, TOGA-COARE, ECMWF, NCEP, AVHRR, ERA, MERRA, solar flux, radiation flux, GEOS-5, CFSR, GDAS, turbulence, chemistry, transport, thickness, radiation, diffusivity, cloud-top roughness, snowfall, emissivity, longwave, shortwave, optical, greeness, evaporation, LAI, sublimation, PDR, kinetic energy, NARR, freezing, detrainment, radiosonde, dropsonde, aircraft, balloon, ship, buoy, wind profiler, RAOB, ITOVS ","modified":"2010","publisher":"Department of Commerce","person":"NOAA\/ESRL PSD Data Management","mbox":"cathy.smith@noaa.gov","identifier":"DOC-4253","accessLevel":"public","dataDictionary":"http:\/\/reanalyses.org\/atmosphere\/overview-current-reanalyses","accessURL":"http:\/\/reanalyses.org\/atmosphere\/how-obtainplotanalyze-data","format":"netcdf3","webService":"","license":"","spatial":"Global ","temporal":"1871-Present","issued":"2010","accrualPeriodicity":"Hourly, Daily, Monthly ","language":"","granularity":"output:  grid (Varies)  ","dataQuality":"","theme":"Section 6.

This crawl operates continually and will be retrieving both already-submitted documents and new documents as the USPTO makes them publicly available.\r\rExcept for repackaging into zip files, these documents are hosted by Google unchanged. A single zip file is created for each patent application. There is detailed documentation about the format as well as the overview below.\r\rHow to access PAIR data\rTo access a particular zipfile, replace \"APP_NUM\" in the following URL with an application number of interest:\r\rhttp:\/\/commondatastorage.googleapis.com\/uspto-pair\/applications\/APP_NUM.zip    For example: http:\/\/commondatastorage.googleapis.com\/uspto-pair\/applications\/12102391.zip                                                                                                  Over 550,000 applications are available. Additional applications will be added regularly as the crawl progresses. \r\rOverview of zipfile contents\rEach zipfile contains the following:\r\r- A README.txt file which indicates when the data was obtained.\r- Data files (*.tsv), in tab-delimited text format, compatible with many spreadsheet programs. Each data file represents one tab from the PAIR interface: Address and Attorney\/Agent, Application Data, Continuity Data, Foreign Priority, Image File Wrapper, Patent Term Adjustments \/ Extension History, Transaction History. \r- Data tables from the PAIR interface are organized in one of two ways: \r1.Labels in the first column. (Example: \"Application Data\" tab.) The second column contains the corresponding value (example: \"Application number\" and \"12\/102,391\").\r2.Labels in the first row. (Example: \"Transaction History\" tab, with labels such as \"Date\" and \"Transaction Description\".) Each subsequent row contains the corresponding values for one data item. (In the example, each row represents a single transaction.)\r- Some *.tsv files contain more than one table, separated by a blank line. \r- The \"Image File Wrapper\" data file is put in a separate directory along with the additional content that it links to. An extra \"Filename\" column is added to the *.tsv file to indicate the appropriate file for each item.\r- Image files (*.pdf), in Adobe PDF format. This data is only available for patent applications which have an \"Image File Wrapper\" tab on the USPTO PAIR site. \rDisclaimer\rNo guarantees are made with respect to the completeness or accuracy of this data. In particular, the crawl may discover and retrieve additional documents over time, even for applications submitted long ago. Please visit the USPTO PAIR site for official, current, and complete information.\r\rAvailable applications\rAs of 2011-03-01, we have data for 557,496 patent applications, including most of the published applications in the following ranges: \r08000001 - 08033366\r08100000 - 08134568\r08200000 - 08235165\r09800000 - 09829887\r09900000 - 09930278\r10000001 - 10024198\r10100000 - 10126373\r10200000 - 10221198\r10300001 - 10320839\r10400000 - 10416691\r10500000 - 10522314\r10600001 - 10618797\r10700000 - 10719621\r10800001 - 10815533\r10900000 - 10920020\r11000001 - 11048436\r11100000 - 11115288\r11200000 - 11214805\r11300000 - 11316288\r11400000 - 11415735\r11500000 - 11515038\r11600000 - 11615977\r11700000 - 11716134\r11800000 - 11814900\r11900000 - 11914299\r12000001 - 12016975\r12100001 - 12118438\r12200000 - 12219134\r12300000 - 12320004\r12400000 - 12425351\r12500000 - 12518850\r12600000 - 12620771\r29000001 - 29026192\r60000003 - 60001535\r90000001 - 90006696\r95000001 - 95001409","keyword":"Offers patent application status information for published patent applications and patent grants.

Climate prediction models require accurate estimates of SST to initialize their ocean component. Drifting buoys provide essential ground truth SST data for this purpose. The models also require validation by comparison with independent data sets. Surface velocity measurements are used for this validation.\rThe AOML Drifter Operations Center manages the deployment of drifting buoys around the world. Using research ships, Volunteer Observation Ships (VOS) and aircraft, Lagrangian drifters are placed in areas of interest. Once verified operational, they are reported to AOML's Drifter Data Assembly Center. Incoming data from the drifters are then placed on the Global Telecommunications System (GTS) for distribution to meteorological services everywhere.

All stations measure wind speed, direction, and gust; barometric pressure; and air temperature. In addition, all buoy stations, and some C-MAN stations, measure sea surface temperature and wave height and period. Conductivity and water current are measured at selected stations. NDBC also operates an array of 39 DART (Tsunami) stations.

The NWLON is a network of 200+ long-term, continuously operating water-level stations throughout the USA, including its island possessions and territories and the Great Lakes. The NWLON has expanded over time in response to increasing national and local needs. NWLON stations are the foundation for reference stations for NOAA's tide prediction products, and serve as controls in determining tidal datums for all short-term water-level stations. NWLON has taken advantage of technological advancements in sensors, data collection and data communications which have enabled routine real-time automated and event-driven data acquisition using the GOES satellite. NWLON data-collection platforms are capable of measuring other oceanographic parameters in addition to water levels, including meteorological parameters. Because of these advancements, the application of NWLON data and products has broadened. For instance, the NWLON is a key part of the NOAA Tsunami Warning System and the NOAA Storm Surge Warning System. NWLON stations support Physical Oceanographic Real-Time Systems (PORTS) in major ports and harbors. NWLON stations have standard configurations of water level sensors (including backup sensors), backup and primary data-collection platforms, solar panel power, GOES satellite radios, and telephone modems. Sensors are calibrated and vertically referenced to nearby networks of benchmarks. The data continuity, the vertical stability and careful referencing of NWLON stations have enabled the data to be used to estimate relative sea-level trends for the Nation.","keyword":"tides, prediction, tidal, water levels, currents, salinity, winds, pressure, temperature, SST ","modified":"2011","publisher":"Department of Commerce","person":"User Services Center for Operational Products and Services (CO-OPS)","mbox":"CO-OPS.USERSERVICES@noaa.gov","identifier":"DOC-5267","accessLevel":"public","dataDictionary":"http:\/\/www.tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov\/publications\/glossary2.pdf","accessURL":"http:\/\/www.tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov\/nwlon.html","format":"CSV\/TXT, PDF, KML\/KMZ, TSV, XML","webService":"","license":"","spatial":"\rUnited States, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, Wake Island, Barbuda  \r","temporal":"1854-2011","issued":"1996","accrualPeriodicity":"every 6 minutes","language":"","granularity":"","dataQuality":"","theme":"Section 6.

The product is intended to delineate areas of the contiguous U. S. where the pre-existing fuel conditions, combined with forecast weather conditions during the next 8 days will result in a significant threat for wildfires.\r\rThere are three types of Fire Weather Outlook areas - a Critical Fire Weather Area for Wind and Relative Humidity, an Extremely Critical Fire Weather Area for Extreme Conditions of Wind and Relative Humidity, and a Critical Fire Weather Area for Dry Thunderstorms.\r\rThe SPC Fire Weather Outlook is comprised of a Day 1 and a Day 2 forecast, in addition to a Day 3-8 forecast. Each forecast period will contain text products along with corresponding graphic products. The Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook is scheduled for issuance at 4:00 AM CST\/CDT and is updated at 17Z. The Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook is scheduled for issuance at 10Z and is updated at 20Z. The Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook is scheduled for issuance at 22Z.\r\rThe Day 1 Outlook covers the 24-hour period from 12Z on the morning of product issuance to 12Z the following morning, with the update covering the 19-hour period from 17Z at issuance to 12Z the following morning. The Day 2 Outlook covers the following 24-hour period out to 48 hours. The Day 3-8 Outlook covers the period of 48 to 192 hours from 12Z on the morning of product issuance.\r\rThe outlook type depends upon the severity of the forecast weather, antecedent conditions, and climatology relative to the given geographic region. Critical Fire Weather Areas for Wind and Relative Humidity are typically issued when strong winds (>20 mph) and low RH are expected to occur where dried fuels exist. Critical Fire Weather for Dry Thunderstorms are typically issued when widespread or numerous thunderstorms producing little wetting rain (<0.10 in) are expected to occur where dried fuels exist. Extremely Critical Fire Weather Areas for Wind and Relative Humidity are issued when very strong winds and very low RH are expected to occur with very dry fuels. Extremely Critical areas will be rarely issued, similar to the very low frequency of High Risk Convective Outlooks.

The lake surface temperatures are derived from NOAA polar-orbiting satellite imagery obtained through the Great Lakes CoastWatch program. The addition of ice cover information was implemented in early 1999, using data provided by the National Ice Center (NIC). Lake surface temperatures are updated daily with information from the cloud-free portions of the previous day's satellite imagery. If no imagery is available, a smoothing algorithm is applied to the previous day's map. Ice information will then be added, using the most recent Great Lakes Ice Analysis produced by NIC, currently daily during the ice season. GLERL is currently receiving a product suite of an average of 108 enhanced digital images including satellite-derived surface temperature (Fig. 1.1), visible and near-infrared reflectance, brightness temperatures, cloud masks, and satellite\/solar zenith angle data from the NOAA\/AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer).

The inundation analysis program is extremely beneficial in determining the frequency (or the occurrence of high waters for different elevations above a specified threshold) and duration (or the amount of time that the specified location is inundated by water) of observed high waters (tides). Statistical output from these analyses can be useful in planning marsh restoration activities. Additionally, the analyses have broader applications for the coastal engineering and mapping community, such as, ecosystem management and regional climate change. Since these statistical outputs are station specific, use for evaluating surrounding areas may be limited.\rProducts\rThe data input for this tool is 6-minute water level data time series and the tabulated times and heights of the high tides over a user specified time period, relative to a desired tidal datum or user-specified datum. The data output of this tool provides summary statistics, which includes the number of occurrences of inundation above the threshold (events) and length of duration of inundation of each events above the threshold elevation for a specified time period. In addition to summary statistics, graphical outputs are provided using three plots. The first plot is a histogram of frequency of occurrence relative to the threshold elevation, the second plot is a histogram of the frequency of duration of inundation, and the third plot is an X-Y plot of frequency of elevation versus duration of inundation for each event. Input data time series are presently limited to the verified data from a set of operating and historical tide stations in the NOAA CO-OPS data base.\r","keyword":"inundation, analysis, tool, tides, water level, sea level, frequency, duration\r","modified":"12\/21\/11","publisher":"Department of Commerce","person":"User Services","mbox":"co-ops.userservices@noaa.gov","identifier":"DOC-6182","accessLevel":"public","dataDictionary":"http:\/\/tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov\/publications\/glossary2.pdf","accessURL":"http:\/\/tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov\/inundation","format":"txt, csv","webService":"","license":"","spatial":"U.S. coastal waters including Alaska and Hawaii, Guam, Puerto Rico\r","temporal":"06\/30\/1854 to present","issued":"12\/21\/11","accrualPeriodicity":"Data collected every 6 minutes","language":"","granularity":"latitude \/ longitude","dataQuality":"","theme":"Section 6.

In this capacity, GLERL obtains, produces, and delivers environmental data and products for near real-time observation of the Great Lakes to support environmental science, decision making, and supporting research. This is achieved by providing access to near real-time and retrospective satellite observations and in-situ Great Lakes data. The goals and objectives of the CoastWatch Great Lakes Program directly support NOAA's statutory responsibilities in estuarine and marine science living marine resource protection, and ecosystem monitoring and management.\r\rThe CoastWatch node at GLERL provides clients including Federal, state, and local agencies, academic institutions, commercial\/industries and the public, both within and outside of the Great Lakes region, with access to near real-time satellite observations and in-situ data for the Great Lakes. CoastWatch data are used in a variety of ways, including near real-time observation and tracking of algal blooms, plumes, ice cover, wind, water intake temperatures at fish hatcheries, two and three dimensional modeling of Great Lakes physical parameters such as wave height and currents damage assessment modeling, research, and educational and recreational activities. In addition, through a cooperative project with Michigan Sea Grant, Great Lakes CoastWatch satellite-derived surface temperature imagery is contoured and made available via Michigan State Sea Grant's web site. Great Lakes CoastWatch data and products benefit riparians as well as commercial and recreational users.\r\rGLERL is currently receiving a product suite of 33 enhanced digital images including satellite-derived surface temperature (Fig. 1.1), visible and near-infrared reflectance, brightness temperatures, cloud masks, and satellite\/solar zenith angle data from the NOAA\/AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) series of satellites as well as GOES (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites) visible, near infrared, and water vapor data. These products are acquired by GLERL from NOAA's National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) on a daily schedule via Internet. In addition, MODIS true color 250m resolution imagery (Fig. 1.2) of each Great Lake (received near real-time from the Space Science and Engineering Center at the University of Wisconsin), in-situ and modeled data, including marine and meteorological observations, buoy observations, water level gauge measurements from NOAA's National Ocean Service, and Great Lakes Surface Environmental Analysis (GLSEA) composite charts (Fig. 1.3), are routinely acquired or produced, stored, and made available to Great Lakes CoastWatch data users.
