Calculator users can now review and change the assumptions behind the ERS cost estimates for either STEC O157 or Salmonella. The assumptions that can be modified include the annual number of cases, the distribution of cases by severity, the use or costs of medical care, the amount or value of time lost from work, the costs of premature death, and the disutility costs for nonfatal cases. Users can also update the cost estimate for inflation for any year from 1997 to 2007.","keyword":"economics, food safety, foodborne illness, United States economy, pathogens, salmonella, campylobacter, listeria, e. coli, salmonellosis, medical costs, productivity, disutility, premature death, ERS, USDA","modified":"05\/22\/09","publisher":"Department of Agriculture","person":"Paul Frenzen","mbox":"pfrenzen@ers.usda.gov","identifier":"USDA-987","accessLevel":"public","dataDictionary":"","accessURL":"http:\/\/www.ers.usda.gov\/Data\/FoodBorneIllness\/","format":"TXT","webService":"","license":"","spatial":"United States","temporal":"1997-2008","issued":"03\/31\/06","accrualPeriodicity":"annual","language":"","granularity":"National","dataQuality":"","theme":"Section 3.

These data provide comprehensive and accurate information on milk supplies, utilization, and sales, as well as class prices established under the orders and prices paid to dairy farmers (producers). The sources of this data are monthly reports of receipts and utilization, producer payroll reports, and reports of nonpool handlers filed by milk processors (handlers) subject to the provisions of the various milk orders. The local market administrator (MA) uses these reports to determine pool obligations under the order and to verify proper payments to producers. Auditors employed by the MA review handler records to assure the accuracy of reported information. Reporting errors are corrected; if necessary, pool obligations are revised.\r\rAfter the pool obligations have been determined the local market administrator summarizes the individual handler reports and submits a series of order summary reports to the Market Information Branch (MIB) in Dairy Programs. The MIB summarizes the individual order data and disseminates this information via monthly, bimonthly, and annual releases or publications. Since milk marketing order statistics are based on reports filed by the population of possible reporting firms and not a sample, these statistics are comprehensive. Also, since these individual firm reports are subject to audit and verification, these statistics are accurate.\r\rThe Federal milk order statistics database contains historical information, beginning in January 2000, generated by the administration of the Federal milk order program. Most of the information in the database has been published previously by the Market Information Branch in Dairy Programs either on its web site or in the Dairy Market News Report. New users are encouraged to use the \"User Guide\" to learn how to navigate the search screens.

What happens when school lets out? Hunger is one of the most severe roadblocks to the learning process. Lack of nutrition during the summer months may set up a cycle for poor performance once school begins again. Hunger also may make children more prone to illness and other health issues.

LCA describes the life cycle as consecutive and interlinked stages of a product system extending from the acquisition of raw materials through materials processing, technology manufacturing\/construction, technology use\/maintenance\/upgrade, and the technology retirement. LCA also provides a framework for understanding economic and social impacts. In an LCA, data are collected at the unit process level, intended to represent a single industrial activity, in this case the food and agriculture industry. Each single industrial activity (a) produces product and sometimes co-products; (b) uses resources from the environment; (c) uses resources from other unit processes in the technosphere; and (d) generates emissions to the environment. In an LCA, the inventory analysis combines unit process data for the life cycle and the impact assessment estimates the impact associated with activities and flows to and from the environment for the inventory.

The LCA Digital Commons database is an open access database developed by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Library (NAL) for use in LCAs to support policy assessment, technology implementation decision-making, and publically disclosed comparative product or technology assertions. Field crop production data include the following processes: Residue burning; soil preparation; planting or sowing; irrigation; application, storage, and transport of fertilizers, manures, liming materials, secondary materials, and pesticides; and harvest.

The goal of the system is to promote analyses and interpretations of historic and current data by improving data access. The publicly accessible part of the system consists of an interactive Web site, which provides an interface to the data, and a relational database, which is used to process, store, and manage data. In addition, DAP was expanded to put sediment, meteorological, soil moisture and temperature, vegetation, CO2 and water flux, geographic information system (GIS) and aircraft and satellite spectral imagery data on line and to publish metadata for all WGEW long-term measurements.","keyword":"Hydrology, precipitation, runoff, semi-arid, soil, erosion, sediment, meteorology, soil moisture, soil temperature, vegetation, CO2 flux, water flux, geographic information system, GIS, satellite spectral imagery, aircraft spectral imagery, Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed, Santa Rita Experimental Range, Upper San Pedro River, Upper San Pedro Partnership","modified":"4\/19\/2013","publisher":"Department of Agriculture","person":"Jason Wong","mbox":"jason.wong@ars.usda.gov","identifier":"USDA-26441","accessLevel":"public","dataDictionary":"Moran, M.S., Emmerich, W.E., Goodrich, D.C., Heilman, P., Holifield Collins, C., Keefer, T.O., Nearing, M.A., Nichols, M.H., Renard, K.G., Scott, R.L., Smith, J.R., Stone, J.J., Unkrich, C.L., Wong, J.K. 2008.

These data are of national and international importance and make up one of the most comprehensive semiarid watershed data sets in the world. The USDA-ARS Southwest Watershed Research Center has recently developed an electronic data processing system that includes an online interface (http:\/\/tucson.ars.ag.gov\/dap) to provide public access to the data. The goal of the system is to promote analyses and interpretations of historic and current data by improving data access. The publicly accessible part of the system consists of an interactive Web site, which provides an interface to the data, and a relational database, which is used to process, store, and manage data. In addition, DAP was expanded to put sediment, meteorological, soil moisture and temperature, vegetation, CO2 and water flux, geographic information system (GIS) and aircraft and satellite spectral imagery data on line and to publish metadata for all WGEW long-term measurements.","keyword":"Hydrology, precipitation, runoff, semi-arid, soil, erosion, sediment, meteorology, soil moisture, soil temperature, vegetation, CO2 flux, water flux, geographic information system, GIS, satellite spectral imagery, aircraft spectral imagery, Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed, Santa Rita Experimental Range, Upper San Pedro River, Upper San Pedro Partnership","modified":"04\/19\/2013","publisher":"Department of Agriculture","person":"Jason Wong","mbox":"jason.wong@ars.usda.gov","identifier":"USDA-26451","accessLevel":"public","dataDictionary":"Moran, M.S., Emmerich, W.E., Goodrich, D.C., Heilman, P., Holifield Collins, C., Keefer, T.O., Nearing, M.A., Nichols, M.H., Renard, K.G., Scott, R.L., Smith, J.R., Stone, J.J., Unkrich, C.L., Wong, J.K. 2008.

For the DSID studies, representative supplement products are identified, sampled and analyzed by experienced laboratories. In order to obtain accurate results, a quality assurance and quality control plan are established for each study, with standard reference materials, in-house control materials and product duplicate results assessed before product data are accepted as final.  Laboratory data are then statistically evaluated by ingredient and weighted by market share information, if available. For the MVM studies released in DSID-2, data are reported by ingredient across a range of labeled levels.  Results are predicted by regression and estimate mean percent differences from label and standard errors at these labeled levels. These data can be used by researchers to more accurately quantify nutrient intake from dietary supplements.","keyword":"nutrition, nutrient composition of foods, dietary supplement, multivitamin, vitamin","modified":"03\/26\/2002","publisher":"Department of Agriculture","person":"Joel Palachuvattil","mbox":"joel.palachuvattil@ars.usda.gov","identifier":"USDA-30781","accessLevel":"public","dataDictionary":"http:\/\/dsid.usda.nih.gov\/dsid_database\/DataFileDescription3-22-12.pdf","accessURL":["http:\/\/dsid.usda.nih.gov\/dsid_database\/complete_dsid_2_data_file.xls","http:\/\/dsid.usda.nih.gov\/dsid_database\/complete_dsid_2_data_file.mdb","http:\/\/dsid.usda.nih.gov\/dsid_database\/table1.sas7bdat","http:\/\/dsid.usda.nih.gov\/dsid_database\/tablea1.sas7bdat"],"format":[".xls",".mdb",".sas7bdat",".sas7bdat"],"webService":"","license":"","spatial":"contiguous United States","temporal":"2003-2008","issued":"05\/01\/2009","accrualPeriodicity":"n\/a","language":"","granularity":"","dataQuality":"","theme":"Section 3.
