The Project uses a recently-developed Ensemble Filter data assimilation method which directly yields each six-hourly analysis as the most likely state of the global atmosphere, and also estimates uncertainty in that analysis.  This dataset will provide the first estimates of global tropospheric and stratospheric variability spanning 1871 to present at six-hourly resolution (V2).

This model is used to measure the movement of surface currents over time, as well as the movement of what is in or on the water.  Ocean surface currents affect organisms suspended in the water column - such as fish eggs, small larvae, and plankton - and may affect their survival by determining their location after a few months of drift.  Even swimming or migrating fish or mammals may have their destinations significantly offset by currents or the annual variability of currents.  OSCURS has gained visibility as an accidental debris tracker to analyze accidental but fortuitous at-sea events beyond the scale of normal oceanographic science.  Investigations of events such as spills of cargo containers loaded with plastic bathtub toys have been used to fine-tune the OSCURS model.","keyword":"currents, fisheries, debris, tracker, numerical model, North Pacific Ocean   ","modified":"11\/5\/2010","publisher":"Department of Commerce","person":"Lynn Dewitt","mbox":"Lynn.Dewitt@noaa.gov","identifier":"DOC-4105","accessLevel":"public","dataDictionary":"http:\/\/las.pfeg.noaa.gov\/thredds\/dodsC\/oscurs_model\/oscurs_pressure.nc.html ","accessURL":"http:\/\/las.pfeg.noaa.gov\/oscurs\/","format":"CSV","webService":"","license":"","spatial":"North Pacific Ocean","temporal":"1967-Present","issued":"01\/2001","accrualPeriodicity":"Daily","language":"","granularity":"","dataQuality":"","theme":"Section 6.

A reanalysis dataset typically extends over several decades or longer, and covers the entire globe from the Earth's surface to well above the stratosphere.  Reanalysis products are used extensively in climate research and services, including for monitoring and comparing current climate conditions with those of the past, identifying the causes of climate variations and change, and preparing climate predictions. Recently, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Aeronautical and Space Administration (NASA), European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), and Japanese Meterological Agency (JMA) have produced new reanalysis datasets that, in total, span 1871 to present. It is crucial to our scientific understanding of climate variability and change that these new datasets be validated and compared with each other and with the underlying observations. International working groups of the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS, the climate element of the Global Earth Observing System of Systems) and the World Climate Research Program, and the Atmospheric Circulation Reconstruction over the Earth (ACRE) initiative need a community portal to exchange quickly and disseminate publicly results of such intercomparisons. NOAA's own mission and strategic goals regarding reanalyzes, as well as its leading role in the US Global Change Research Program, GCOS, WCRP, and ACRE, make NOAA the logical and obvious choice to serve a website dedicated to improving understanding of the international reanalysis datasets, including those recently generated by NOAA, the 20th Century Reanalysis and Climate Forecast System Reanalysis.  The new website \"reanalyses.org\" will serve as a central portal for Reanalysis Intercomparison and Observations (RIO) by NOAA, NASA, ECMWF, JMA, and national and international scientists. The website should be outside the \"noaa.gov\" domain. It will help NOAA and the international scientific community to improve the climate science and services that reanalyzes underpin.\r\rNOAA strategic plans and US Global Climate Research Program plans to which NOAA Office of Atmospheric Research and the new NOAA Climate Service will respond specifically call for advances in understanding reanalysis datasets. The RIO will coordinate with the NOAA Climate Services portal to make the intercomparison and observation documentation public. \r \r","keyword":"pressure, MSL, humidity, SST, sea ice, global, upper-level winds, ozone, meridional winds, zonal winds, u-wind, v-wind, geopotential height,  temperature, solar radiation,  convection, potential energy, gravity wave, cloud liquid, omega,  vertical velocity,  water, precipitable water,  cloud microphysics, carbon dioxide,  volcano, aerosol, grids, soil moisture, soil temperature, CAPE, CIN, albedo, ground heat, planetary boundary height, ice concentration, ice thickness, latent heat flux, potential evaporation, runoff, sensible heat, snow depth, snow cover, cloud cover, transpiration, momentum flux, wspd, hydrological, dewpoint, precipitation, radiance, TOVS, SSM\/I, ERS, ATOVS, GATE, FGGE, ALPEX, TOGA-COARE, ECMWF, NCEP, AVHRR, ERA, MERRA, solar flux, radiation flux, GEOS-5, CFSR, GDAS, turbulence, chemistry, transport, thickness, radiation, diffusivity, cloud-top roughness, snowfall, emissivity, longwave, shortwave, optical, greeness, evaporation, LAI, sublimation, PDR, kinetic energy, NARR, freezing, detrainment, radiosonde, dropsonde, aircraft, balloon, ship, buoy, wind profiler, RAOB, ITOVS ","modified":"2010","publisher":"Department of Commerce","person":"NOAA\/ESRL PSD Data Management","mbox":"cathy.smith@noaa.gov","identifier":"DOC-4253","accessLevel":"public","dataDictionary":"http:\/\/reanalyses.org\/atmosphere\/overview-current-reanalyses","accessURL":"http:\/\/reanalyses.org\/atmosphere\/how-obtainplotanalyze-data","format":"netcdf3","webService":"","license":"","spatial":"Global ","temporal":"1871-Present","issued":"2010","accrualPeriodicity":"Hourly, Daily, Monthly ","language":"","granularity":"output:  grid (Varies)  ","dataQuality":"","theme":"Section 6.

Also, a severe mammal die-off occurred, where more than 700 bottlenose dolphins died off the mid-Atlantic coast. Both instances prompted Federal and State officials to explore additional data sources for monitoring the coastal waters, such as near real-time satellite data.\r\rCoastWatch has expanded from POES\/AVHRR SST data for the East Coast to providing a variety of environmental data (i.e. SST, ocean color, winds, etc.) from several different satellite platforms covering all U.S. coastal waters, including Hawaii and Alaska. Today, sea surface temperature maps support meteorological weather predictions and also support commercial and recreational activities (e.g., fishing). Biologists utilize ocean color radiometry data and derived chlorophyll-a and total suspended matter\/turbidity products to identify runoff plumes and blooms and also predict HABs; and sailors and commercial shipping pilots use ocean surface vector winds for safe navigation.","keyword":"buoys, radar, satellites, shore,   SST, salinity, currents, upwelling, temperature, waves, winds, SLP, pressure, salinity, PH, turbidity, chlorophyll, CoastWatch, POES, AVHRR, MODIS, Ocean Color, Clarity, Terra, Aqua, SeaWiFs,HAB, Algal Bloom, Envisat,   OrbView-2, GOES, SEVERI, Meteosat, QuikSCAT, DMSP,  SSM\/I, Reflectance, Ice Coverage, Altimeter,  Carbon Dioxide,Volcano, Visible, Infrared, biology, sea nettles, primary productivity, OSCAR, roughness, oil spill, MOBY, CBOS, hurricane, storm runoff, plumes, hazard, fronts, eddies   ","modified":"2010","publisher":"Department of Commerce","person":"Kent Hughes ","mbox":"Kent.Hughes@noaa.gov","identifier":"DOC-4267","accessLevel":"public","dataDictionary":"http:\/\/coastwatch.noaa.gov\/cwn\/cw_resources.html","accessURL":"http:\/\/coastwatch.noaa.gov\/cwn\/search\/interface.html","format":"HDF, GeoTIFF, PNG, Shapefile","webService":"","license":"","spatial":"Global ","temporal":"1995-2010","issued":"1996","accrualPeriodicity":"Daily, Hourly ","language":"","granularity":"","dataQuality":"","theme":"Section 6.

The primary goal of the DAC is to assemble and provide uniform quality control of sea surface temperature (SST) and surface velocity measurements. These measurements are obtained as part of an international program designed to make these data available in an effort to improve climate prediction. Climate prediction models require accurate estimates of SST to initialize their ocean component. Drifting buoys provide essential ground truth SST data for this purpose. The models also require validation by comparison with independent data sets. Surface velocity measurements are used for this validation.\rThe AOML Drifter Operations Center manages the deployment of drifting buoys around the world. Using research ships, Volunteer Observation Ships (VOS) and aircraft, Lagrangian drifters are placed in areas of interest.

NWS forecasters need frequent, high-quality marine observations to examine conditions for forecast preparation and to verify their forecasts after they are produced. Other users rely on the observations and forecasts for commercial and recreational activities. NDBC provides regular observations from a network of about 110 buoys and 60 Coastal Marine Automated Network (C-MAN) stations, and 55 Tropical Atmosphere Ocean (TAO) stations, to help meet these needs. All stations measure wind speed, direction, and gust; barometric pressure; and air temperature. In addition, all buoy stations, and some C-MAN stations, measure sea surface temperature and wave height and period. Conductivity and water current are measured at selected stations. NDBC also operates an array of 39 DART (Tsunami) stations.  In addition NDBC provides information from Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) partner stations, oil and gas platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, and National Ocean Service (NOS) stations.","keyword":"buoys, winds, waves, atmospheric pressure, temperature, dewpoint, SST, air-sea, C-MAN, currents, visibility, tides, heat index, wind chill, ice accretion, water levels , depth (ocean), conductivity, salinity, oxygen, chlorophyll, turbidity, pH, eH, rainfall, depth, oceans, short-wave, long-wave radiation, tsunami, TAO","modified":"2011","publisher":"Department of Commerce","person":"Kevin Kern, CIO","mbox":"Kevin.Kern@noaa.gov","identifier":"DOC-5229","accessLevel":"public","dataDictionary":"http:\/\/www.ndbc.noaa.gov\/measdes.shtml ","accessURL":"http:\/\/www.ndbc.noaa.gov","format":"CSV\/TXT, KML\/KMZ","webService":"","license":"","spatial":"North Bounding Coordinate:  70\rSouth Bounding Coordinate: -50\rWest Bounding Coordinate: -180\rEast Bounding Coordinate: 180","temporal":"1970-Present","issued":"1996","accrualPeriodicity":"Hourly, Daily, Monthly, Annual ","language":"","granularity":"","dataQuality":"","theme":"Section 6.

The NWLON is a network of 200+ long-term, continuously operating water-level stations throughout the USA, including its island possessions and territories and the Great Lakes. The NWLON has expanded over time in response to increasing national and local needs. NWLON stations are the foundation for reference stations for NOAA's tide prediction products, and serve as controls in determining tidal datums for all short-term water-level stations. NWLON has taken advantage of technological advancements in sensors, data collection and data communications which have enabled routine real-time automated and event-driven data acquisition using the GOES satellite. NWLON data-collection platforms are capable of measuring other oceanographic parameters in addition to water levels, including meteorological parameters. Because of these advancements, the application of NWLON data and products has broadened. For instance, the NWLON is a key part of the NOAA Tsunami Warning System and the NOAA Storm Surge Warning System. NWLON stations support Physical Oceanographic Real-Time Systems (PORTS) in major ports and harbors. NWLON stations have standard configurations of water level sensors (including backup sensors), backup and primary data-collection platforms, solar panel power, GOES satellite radios, and telephone modems. Sensors are calibrated and vertically referenced to nearby networks of benchmarks. The data continuity, the vertical stability and careful referencing of NWLON stations have enabled the data to be used to estimate relative sea-level trends for the Nation.","keyword":"tides, prediction, tidal, water levels, currents, salinity, winds, pressure, temperature, SST ","modified":"2011","publisher":"Department of Commerce","person":"User Services Center for Operational Products and Services (CO-OPS)","mbox":"CO-OPS.USERSERVICES@noaa.gov","identifier":"DOC-5267","accessLevel":"public","dataDictionary":"http:\/\/www.tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov\/publications\/glossary2.pdf","accessURL":"http:\/\/www.tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov\/nwlon.html","format":"CSV\/TXT, PDF, KML\/KMZ, TSV, XML","webService":"","license":"","spatial":"\rUnited States, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, Wake Island, Barbuda  \r","temporal":"1854-2011","issued":"1996","accrualPeriodicity":"every 6 minutes","language":"","granularity":"","dataQuality":"","theme":"Section 6.

Each forecast period will contain text products along with corresponding graphic products. The Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook is scheduled for issuance at 4:00 AM CST\/CDT and is updated at 17Z. The Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook is scheduled for issuance at 10Z and is updated at 20Z. The Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook is scheduled for issuance at 22Z.\r\rThe Day 1 Outlook covers the 24-hour period from 12Z on the morning of product issuance to 12Z the following morning, with the update covering the 19-hour period from 17Z at issuance to 12Z the following morning. The Day 2 Outlook covers the following 24-hour period out to 48 hours. The Day 3-8 Outlook covers the period of 48 to 192 hours from 12Z on the morning of product issuance.\r\rThe outlook type depends upon the severity of the forecast weather, antecedent conditions, and climatology relative to the given geographic region. Critical Fire Weather Areas for Wind and Relative Humidity are typically issued when strong winds (>20 mph) and low RH are expected to occur where dried fuels exist. Critical Fire Weather for Dry Thunderstorms are typically issued when widespread or numerous thunderstorms producing little wetting rain (<0.10 in) are expected to occur where dried fuels exist. Extremely Critical Fire Weather Areas for Wind and Relative Humidity are issued when very strong winds and very low RH are expected to occur with very dry fuels. Extremely Critical areas will be rarely issued, similar to the very low frequency of High Risk Convective Outlooks.

The lake surface temperatures are derived from NOAA polar-orbiting satellite imagery obtained through the Great Lakes CoastWatch program. The addition of ice cover information was implemented in early 1999, using data provided by the National Ice Center (NIC). Lake surface temperatures are updated daily with information from the cloud-free portions of the previous day's satellite imagery. If no imagery is available, a smoothing algorithm is applied to the previous day's map. Ice information will then be added, using the most recent Great Lakes Ice Analysis produced by NIC, currently daily during the ice season. GLERL is currently receiving a product suite of an average of 108 enhanced digital images including satellite-derived surface temperature (Fig. 1.1), visible and near-infrared reflectance, brightness temperatures, cloud masks, and satellite\/solar zenith angle data from the NOAA\/AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer).

The inundation analysis program is extremely beneficial in determining the frequency (or the occurrence of high waters for different elevations above a specified threshold) and duration (or the amount of time that the specified location is inundated by water) of observed high waters (tides). Statistical output from these analyses can be useful in planning marsh restoration activities. Additionally, the analyses have broader applications for the coastal engineering and mapping community, such as, ecosystem management and regional climate change. Since these statistical outputs are station specific, use for evaluating surrounding areas may be limited.\rProducts\rThe data input for this tool is 6-minute water level data time series and the tabulated times and heights of the high tides over a user specified time period, relative to a desired tidal datum or user-specified datum. The data output of this tool provides summary statistics, which includes the number of occurrences of inundation above the threshold (events) and length of duration of inundation of each events above the threshold elevation for a specified time period. In addition to summary statistics, graphical outputs are provided using three plots. The first plot is a histogram of frequency of occurrence relative to the threshold elevation, the second plot is a histogram of the frequency of duration of inundation, and the third plot is an X-Y plot of frequency of elevation versus duration of inundation for each event. Input data time series are presently limited to the verified data from a set of operating and historical tide stations in the NOAA CO-OPS data base.\r","keyword":"inundation, analysis, tool, tides, water level, sea level, frequency, duration\r","modified":"12\/21\/11","publisher":"Department of Commerce","person":"User Services","mbox":"co-ops.userservices@noaa.gov","identifier":"DOC-6182","accessLevel":"public","dataDictionary":"http:\/\/tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov\/publications\/glossary2.pdf","accessURL":"http:\/\/tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov\/inundation","format":"txt, csv","webService":"","license":"","spatial":"U.S. coastal waters including Alaska and Hawaii, Guam, Puerto Rico\r","temporal":"06\/30\/1854 to present","issued":"12\/21\/11","accrualPeriodicity":"Data collected every 6 minutes","language":"","granularity":"latitude \/ longitude","dataQuality":"","theme":"Section 6.

In this capacity, GLERL obtains, produces, and delivers environmental data and products for near real-time observation of the Great Lakes to support environmental science, decision making, and supporting research. This is achieved by providing access to near real-time and retrospective satellite observations and in-situ Great Lakes data. The goals and objectives of the CoastWatch Great Lakes Program directly support NOAA's statutory responsibilities in estuarine and marine science living marine resource protection, and ecosystem monitoring and management.\r\rThe CoastWatch node at GLERL provides clients including Federal, state, and local agencies, academic institutions, commercial\/industries and the public, both within and outside of the Great Lakes region, with access to near real-time satellite observations and in-situ data for the Great Lakes. CoastWatch data are used in a variety of ways, including near real-time observation and tracking of algal blooms, plumes, ice cover, wind, water intake temperatures at fish hatcheries, two and three dimensional modeling of Great Lakes physical parameters such as wave height and currents damage assessment modeling, research, and educational and recreational activities. In addition, through a cooperative project with Michigan Sea Grant, Great Lakes CoastWatch satellite-derived surface temperature imagery is contoured and made available via Michigan State Sea Grant's web site. Great Lakes CoastWatch data and products benefit riparians as well as commercial and recreational users.\r\rGLERL is currently receiving a product suite of 33 enhanced digital images including satellite-derived surface temperature (Fig. 1.1), visible and near-infrared reflectance, brightness temperatures, cloud masks, and satellite\/solar zenith angle data from the NOAA\/AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) series of satellites as well as GOES (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites) visible, near infrared, and water vapor data. These products are acquired by GLERL from NOAA's National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) on a daily schedule via Internet. In addition, MODIS true color 250m resolution imagery (Fig. 1.2) of each Great Lake (received near real-time from the Space Science and Engineering Center at the University of Wisconsin), in-situ and modeled data, including marine and meteorological observations, buoy observations, water level gauge measurements from NOAA's National Ocean Service, and Great Lakes Surface Environmental Analysis (GLSEA) composite charts (Fig. 1.3), are routinely acquired or produced, stored, and made available to Great Lakes CoastWatch data users. Great Lakes Forecasting system (nowcast and forecast) products are also available to CoastWatch data users. Near real-time AVHRR satellite data for the past 2 weeks are available at GLERL, and access to a retrospective archive that begins in 1990 is available via an Internet link to the NOAA CoastWatch Active Access System at the NESDIS Satellite Active Archive.
