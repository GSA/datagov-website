(Note that incumbent/challenger status is dynamic in the current election cycle and there may be delays in identifying districts that will involve open seats. Further, the definition of an open seat is one in which the incumbent never sought reelection. Therefore, districts where incumbents lose primaries are not classified as open seat.)
