Common field samples include air filters and soil samples. Radiochemistry analysis typically reports the presence of specific radionuclides measured as total activity or as either activity\/unit of mass or activity\/unit of volume, depending upon the sample media. In addition, total beta and total alpha activity may be reported. Currently, air filter and soil sample analysis results may be downloaded through the data repository. Both data sets are similar; they contain a number of columns describing the collected sample as well as the results of radiochemical analysis. In addition, there are a number of special fields that are specific to a given sample type; e.g. Air Filters specify the filter type and total volume, while soil samples specify the sample weight. For convenience, the sample information and subsequent analysis has been flattened into a simple tabular format. Consequently, if a sample has multiple analysis results the sample collection values will be repeated through the set; e.g. sample ID#, barcode, latitude\/longitude, collection date etc. To be included in the data repository, a given sample must meet the following criteria: has a valid latitude, longitude, and collection date; has been sent to a laboratory for analysis, or had analysis performed in the field; has at least one valid analysis result with a reportable unit, nuclide, and activity which has been validated by an authorized laboratory staff member.  These results represent raw data that have been calibrated  to physical units and validated.

SciTech Connect incorporates all of the R&D information from these two products into one search interface. SciTech Connect was developed by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI) to increase access to science, technology, and engineering research information from DOE and its predecessor agencies.\rSciTech Connect contains all the full-text documents and citations previously found in Information Bridge and Energy Citations Database.

This collection continues to grow as new scientific and technical information resulting from DOE research becomes available. \r\rThere are over 2.5 million citations, including citations to 1.4 million journal articles, 364,000 of which have digital object identifiers (DOIs) linking to full-text articles on publishers' websites. SciTech Connect also has over 313,000 full-text DOE sponsored STI reports; most of these are post-1991, but close to 85,000 of the reports were published prior to 1990.\rThe SciTech Connect Basic Search utilizes a semantic search technique called keyword-to-concept mapping.
