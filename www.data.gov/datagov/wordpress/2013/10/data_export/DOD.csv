A Source Code is a unique numeric designation assigned by DTIC to each organization in the database.The purpose of the database is to find the Source Code for an organization.  The Source Code can then be searched in the Technical Reports, Research Summaries, or IR&D databases to find all the reports from an organization, despite variations in its name.  Searching by Source Code Hierarchy enables you to find all reports from an organization plus reports from its suborganizations and reports submitted under previous names.","Corporate Authors, Organization Authors, Information contributors  ",5/30/2012,"Department of Defense","Phyllis Levine",plevine@dtic.mil,DOD-3963,public,http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/pdf/stresources/termexplanation.pdf,http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/stresources/techreports/dticSearchTools/corp_desc.html,html,,,US,"1/1/2012 - 12/31/2012",1/1/2012,Annually,,,,"Section 16.

"Department of Defense Numbers for Traumatic Brain Injury","This information is designed to provide service members, their families, veterans, the general public, and other concerned citizens with the most comprehensive and accurate figures available regarding diagnosed cases of TBI within the U.S. military.

Information is collected from electronic medical records and analyzed by the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center in cooperation with the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center. Numbers for the current year will be updated on a quarterly basis. Other data will be updated annually. At this time, the MHS is unable to provide information regarding cause of injury or location because that information is not available in most medical records. 

 
The numbers represent actual medical diagnoses of TBI within the U.S. Military. Other, larger numbers routinely reported in the media must be considered inaccurate because they do not reflect actual medical diagnoses. Many of these larger numbers are developed utilizing sources such as the Post Deployment Health Assessment (PDHA) or Post Deployment Health Reassessment (PDHRA). However, these documents are assessment tools with TBI screening questions and are not diagnostic tools.","Department of Defense Traumatic Brain Injury Numbers",12/01/2009,"Department of Defense","Dr. Michael Kilpatrick",MHSContent@tma.osd.mil,DOD-5492,public,http://health.mil/Research/TBI_Numbers.aspx,http://health.mil/Research/TBI_Numbers.aspx,PDF,,"not applicable",OCONUS,"Collected quarterly per year (January-December)",12/01/2009,quarterly,,"Not applicable",http://health.mil/Research/TBI_Numbers.aspx,"Section 1.
