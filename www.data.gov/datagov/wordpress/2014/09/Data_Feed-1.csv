Defiance-Chinle agencies, Northern Agency, and Western Agency;  	Conduct environmental assessments of participants homes in support of the studys comprehensive exposure assessment (conducted by RFS with ongoing oversight and training by co-investigator); 	Train NNDOH community health and environmental research specialists (CHERS) to recruit and enroll pregnant Navajo women in the study, and to implement other elements of the approved research protocol (co-investigator);  	On a limited basis in Year 4, distribute outreach materials and give presentations about the study to Navajo audiences, using the Navajo language whenever and wherever appropriate (RFS);  	On a limited basis, collaborate with NNDOH staff and Cohort Clinical Liaisons at NAIHS and PL93-638 healthcare facilities to recruit and enroll eligible women into the study (RFS);  	Prepare community presentations and progress reports for the Navajo Nation Human Research Review Board and the UNM Human Research Review Committee (co-investigator); and 	Assist PI and her staff in coordinating the project, supervising field staff, facilitating community outreach, observing reporting deadlines, and managing budgets (co-investigator).  With respect to the home environmental assessments (HEAs) discussed above, SRIC staff will measure and record data for gamma radiation surveys, indoor radon levels, and metals in dust for all participants homes. For a subset of participants who live near oil- and gas-producing facilities, SRIC will conduct 30-day hydrogen sulfide tests.  For participants who do not have running water in their homes, SRIC will ascertain the unregulated water sources from which the participants obtain their drinking water, and sample and test water in those sources for heavy metals, including uranium, and gross contaminants.  SRIC will coordinate the analysis of dust samples through USEPA Region 9 using protocols previously coordinated between SRIC, USEPA9, and UNM.  SRIC will place the data from their surveys, tests and monitoring in the secure UNM REDCap database for statistical analyses of environmental exposure variables for all study participants. When the study is fully ramped up, we expect to conduct 20 to 25 HEAs per month. SRIC will work with CDCs GRASP division to develop geospatial representation of HEA data, including and especially indoor radon levels, which have never been systematically measured or mapped on the Navajo Nation despite its long history of impacts of development of uranium resources and effects on worker and community health from exposure to radon and radon progeny.  The SRIC field staff (RFS) will assist the NNDOH CHERS and the NBCS-dedicated staff of the participating hospitals (called Cohort Clinical Liaisons, or CCLs) in community outreach and recruitment activities on a limited basis to reduce travel costs in Year 4. If the original Year 4 budget for SRIC is restored, RFS will resume normal outreach and recruitment activities ",0,0,12,2013,2014,,,,,,,,,,,,93.161 Health Program for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry

Objectives for this project are:  7)	reduce wildfire hazard in the wildland urban interface in High Rolls and the surrounding communities; 8)	improve the overall health and vigor of the forest and control disease and insects in High Rolls and the surrounding communities; 9)	improve the productivity and health of the watershed; 10)	increase the vigor and growth rate of residual trees while removing excess, poor quality, and dead and dying trees; 11)	enhance the aesthetic value of the forest; and 12)	Serve as an example to other residents of how active forest management can improve property values.

Past projects have completed shaded fuel breaks as well as restored stands to historical densities on private lands on the Horse Springs Ranch. Treatments will be based on forest restoration principles shown to reduce fire hazard and improve trees per acre average 500-600 stems per acre. Target BAs will range between 50-60 square feet per acre with trees selected to retain a diversity of size and age classes within the stands. The majority of the treatment will take place in and around Chavez Canyon, Bear Canyon, and White Rock Canyon where encroaching piñon/juniper stands have become established and have decreased the natural adaptations of these woodlands to periodic fire intervals as well as drastically reduce the grass and forb components that were present before settlement. These treatments will also reduce the continuity of the vegetation by restoring the natural dumpiness typical of southwest piñon/juniper forests on ridge tops, rock outcroppings, drainages, and valley bottoms. Treating this area will benefit the State Land Office and private lands by preserving and restoring natural and beneficial function of the land and watershed, A wildfire originating south or west of the private lands could easily block the primary escape routes, endangering lives and infrastructure due to the possibility of a perfect alignment of fuels, weather and topography. The vegetation type is primarily piñon/juniper on the mesa tops and ponderosa pine in the numerous small drainages.  Project objectives: 1. Restore historic variability of ponderosa pine and piñon/juniper stands in the area to acceptable levels on a minimum of 197 acres.  2. Decrease the chance of catastrophic/stand replacement wildfires that will do irrevocable harm to the current stand structure, species composition, and ecological balance.  3. Protect infrastructure, structures, and aesthetics from catastrophic events (wildfire, insect, and disease outbreaks, etc.).  4. Improve watershed attributes by decreasing soil erosion and re-establishing native grasses and forbs.  5. Increase soil moisture and decrease soil temperature.  6. Restore forest in the targeted areas, identified in the Catron County CWPP as being at a high risk for catastrophic wildfire.  7. Complement existing and or future Collaborative Forest Restoration/Resource Advisory Council projects where fuel breaks have been or will be constructed on USFS land adjacent to the private property.

Herbicide treatment that will coincide with mechanical treatment will include spraying freshly cut stumps (stump treatment) within 15 minutes of cutting. Spraying re-sprouts during the initial growing season following mechanical treatment will be conducted to secure greater mortality of woody invasive species.

Contractor shall competitively procure the landowners via posting of a notice at the local post office and a legal notice in the Silver City newspaper. The outcome will be that hazardous fuels reduction/fuel break development projects will be conducted on a minimum of 137 acres of private property in the targeted area and will complement previous work completed on the XYZ Ranch and other areas of Sanctuary Canyon.  Project objectives:  1. Restore historic variability of the piñon/juniper and ponderosa pine stands in the area to acceptable levels.  2. Decrease the chance of catastrophic/stand replacement wildfires that will irrevocably harm the current stand structure, species composition, and ecological balance.  3. Protect infrastructure, structures, and aesthetics from catastrophic events (wildfire, insect, and disease outbreaks, etc.).  4. Improve watershed attributes by decreasing soil erosion and re-establishing native grasses and forbs.  5. Increase soil moisture and decrease soil temperature.  6. Restore forest in the targeted areas, identified in the Grant County CWPP as being at a high risk for catastrophic wildfire. The targeted areas are home to approximately 50 residents and over 100 permanent structures.  7. Complement existing Collaborative Forest Restoration Projects where fuel breaks have been constructed on USFS land adjacent to the private properties by thinning properties to the target basal areas referred to under project description.
