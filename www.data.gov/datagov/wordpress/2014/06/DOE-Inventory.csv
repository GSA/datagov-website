DOE,Fermilab,,Fermilab Accelerator Complex,"Fermilab, Fermi National Laboratory Rd",60555,Warrenville,IL,US,"Fermilab's accelerator complex consists of a total of 16km of accelerators and beamlines. It produces the world's most powerful, high-energy neutrino beam and provides proton and neutron beams for various experiments, R&D programs as well as cancer treatment. Several test beams and test areas are available to university and industrial researchers, including:

Fermilab Test Beam Facility (FTBF) delivers high-energy beams via two versatile beamlines (MTest and MCenter) in which users can test equipment or detectors. The MTest primary beamline delivers high energy protons (120 GeV) at moderate intensities (~1-300 kHz). This beam can also be targeted to create secondary, or even tertiary particle beams of energies down to below 1 GeV, consisting of pions, muons, and/or electrons. The MCenter beamline is similar.

The MuCool Test Area is a unique accelerator R&D facility. It includes a cryoplant in a surface building, an underground experimental hall, a beamline to bring a 400-MeV proton beam into the hall, a clean room in the hall for component assembly, 201 and 805 MHz rf power, several rf cavities, a 5-Tesla superconducting solenoid for cavity tests, diagnostic instrumentation for radiation measurements, and infrastructure for liquid hydrogen.

An advanced accelerator test facility is being developed.  It will enable a broad range of beam-based experiments to study fundamental limitations to beam intensity and to develop transformative approaches to particle-beam generation, acceleration and manipulation. 

The Neutron Therapy Facility provides a moderate intensity, broad energy spectrum neutron beam that can be used for short term irradiations for radiobiology (cells) and material science investigations.

Scientists are using the information obtained from the SGP to improve cloud and radiative models and parameterizations and, thereby, the performance of atmospheric general circulation models used for climate research.

Deployment of the first instrumentation to the SGP site occurred in the spring of 1992, just 24 months after the ARM Program was established. The site was dedicated in November 1992. Additional instrumentation and data processing capabilities have been incrementally added in the succeeding years. In 2001, the site was rededicated in the name of Dr. Frederick Luther (1943-1986), who made outstanding contributions to the field of atmospheric research and furthering our understanding of atmospheric radiation and its interactions with clouds, aerosols, and gases. The SGP site consists of in situ and remote-sensing instrument clusters arrayed across approximately 55,000 square miles (143,000 square kilometers) in north-central Oklahoma. The SGP site is the largest and most extensive climate research field site in the world and can be viewed as a real ""laboratory without walls.""

The heart of the SGP site is the heavily instrumented central facility located on 160 acres of cattle pasture and wheat fields southeast of Lamont, Oklahoma. A staff of 30 scientists and technicians collect and monitor data from the central facility instruments and from smaller, unstaffed facilities throughout the site.

The instruments throughout the site automatically collect data on surface and atmospheric properties, routinely providing data to the Site Data System, which is linked by high-speed communications to the ARM Archive and Data Center. The External Data Center acquires additional data from other sources, such as National Weather Service satellite and surface data, and provides tailored data packages to ARM Science Team members.

More than 30 instrument clusters have been placed around the SGP site, at the Central Facility and at Boundary, Extended, and Intermediate Facilities. The locations for the instruments were chosen so that the measurements reflect conditions over the typical distribution of land uses within the site.

The continuous observations at the SGP site are supplemented by intensive observation periods, when the frequency of measurements is increased and special measurements are added to address specific research questions. During such periods, approximately 2 gigabytes or more of data (two billion bytes) is generated daily. Both during intensive observation periods and at other times, scientists bring their own specialized instruments to the SGP site, typically for several weeks.

The SGP was chosen as the first ARM field measurement site for several reasons including its relatively homogeneous geography and easy accessibility, wide variability of climate cloud type and surface flux properties, and large seasonal variation in temperature and specific humidity. It also already had a large, existing network of weather and climate research and instrumentation.",User Facility,http://www.arm.gov/sites/nsa,wanda.ferrel@science.doe.gov,(301) 903-0043

The PCMDI mission is to develop improved methods and tools for the diagnosis and intercomparison of general circulation models (GCMs) that simulate the global climate. The need for innovative analysis of GCM climate simulations is apparent, as increasingly more complex models are developed, while the disagreements among these simulations and relative to climate observations remain significant and poorly understood. The nature and causes of these disagreements must be accounted for in a systematic fashion in order to confidently use GCMs for simulation of putative global climate change.
PCMDI's mission demands that we work on both scientific projects and infrastructural tasks. Our current scientific projects  focus on supporting model intercomparison, on developing a model parameterization testbed, identification of robust Cloud Feedbacks in observations and models and on devising robust statistical methods for climate-change detection/attribution. Examples of ongoing infrastructural tasks include the development of software for data management, visualization, and computation ; the assembly/organization of observational data sets for model validation; and the consistent documentation of climate model features.

(PDL-E,-W)",902 Battelle Blvd,99354,Richland,WA,US,"PDL-E is a high-bay pilot plant facility that includes biomass processing, supercritical fluid processing, and high-pressure chemical processing capabilities. Biomass processing methods for extraction or hydrolysis have been developed in this laboratory and then scaled up for engineering assessment. Similar designs can be used to scale up bioprocessing systems as well. A skid-mounted unit contains a complete continuous-flow high-pressure processing system including pumps, heat exchangers, and feed and product tanks. It is fully instrumented and has a computer-controlled data acquisition system. It has two 2-inch ID by 6-foot tall tubular reactors, each about 4-liters volume, with electrical heating and a tube-in-tube heat recovery system. The system can process at up to 365°C and 3500 psig. The processing system is designed to run at one half ton per day of feed slurry. Pressure is maintained in the reactor system by a back-pressure regulator. After pressure letdown, gas and liquid products enter a separator/liquid product tank from which gas products are vented. Back-up product cool down is accomplished with a forced air fan. For processing, the unit requires minimal setup; it has a single 480-volt input line. Other process engineering equipment is also available including screen and membrane filter systems and supercritical fluid cleaning and extraction systems. 

Also found at the PDL-E are micro-scale reactor systems for testing various gas phase reactions. These reactor systems include the 4-Plex system which allows parallel testing of catalyst formulations with online chemical analytical capability. Two other reactor systems are constructed within ventilation hoods and allow testing of various micro-technology reactor configurations with a range of process gas components. In addition, there are two high-pressure continuous-flow, fixed- catalyst-bed reactors for aqueous phase processes. These micro-scale reactors (30 milliliter bed) allow extended time process testing for catalyst lifetime determination. They are connected to the hydrogen compressor system at CEL to allow long-term, continuous hydrogen gas flow.

PDL-West is also a high-bay facility, most recently has housed the Pretreatment Engineering Platform (PEP), an engineering-scale demonstration of Hanford Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant pretreatment processes. The PEP project included chemical process demonstration work with non-radioactive Hanford tank waste simulants.

",94025,Menlo Park,CA,US,"The LCLS at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (SLAC) is the world’s first hard x-ray free electron laser facility and became operational in June 2010. This is a milestone for x-ray user facilities that advances the state-of-the-art from storage-ring-based third generation synchrotron light sources to a fourth generation Linac-based light source. The LCLS provides laser-like radiation in the x-ray region of the spectrum that is 10 billion times greater in peak power and peak brightness than any existing coherent x-ray light source. The SLAC linac provides high-current, low-emittance 5–15 GeV electron bunches at a 120 Hz repetition rate. A newly constructed long undulator bunches the electrons, leading to self-amplification of the emitted x-ray radiation, constituting the x-ray FEL.",User Facility,http://www-ssrl.slac.stanford.edu/lcls/,,(650) 926-3191
