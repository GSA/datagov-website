      "description": "The Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) project maps the location, extent, and severity of all large fires in the conterminous United States (CONUS), Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico from 1984 to present. All documented fires greater than 1,000 acres in the western U.S. and greater than 500 acres in the eastern U.S. are mapped across all ownerships. The project produces geospatial and tabular data for analysis at a range of spatial, temporal, and thematic scales and are intended to meet a variety of information needs that require consistent data about fire effects through space and time. MTBS is conducted through a partnership between the U.S. Geological Survey National Center for Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) and the USDA Forest Service Remote Sensing Applications Center (RSAC).",

Burn severity layers are thematic images depicting severity as unburned to low, low, moderate, high, and increased greenness (increased post-fire vegetation response). The layer may also have a sixth class representing a mask for clouds, shadows, large water bodies, or other features on the landscape that erroneously affect the severity classification. This data has been prepared as part of the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) project. Due to the lack of comprehensive fire reporting information and quality Landsat imagery, burn severity for all targeted MTBS fires are not available. Additionally, the availability of burn severity data for fires occurring in the current and previous calendar year is variable since these data are currently in production and released on an intermittent basis by the MTBS project.",
