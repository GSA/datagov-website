Transforming data into information puts the data to work, allowing citizens to be more informed, make better decisions, and derive greater value from their government.&nbsp; The datasets on the new platform also feature an open application programming interface (API), making it easier for developers to mash up data and create apps. For fans of the old Data.gov, fear not! The \u201cClassic\u201d version of the catalog will remain available and continue to be updated as new datasets are added.<\/p>\n<h3>Communities Are the Future<\/h3>\n<p>We continue to add to Data.gov Communities, which provide citizens, government, researchers, and industry with a forum to share ideas and feedback about data on topics that are important to the American public and that tie into the missions of many agencies.&nbsp; Communities provide discussion forums and opportunities for collaboration and innovation among data consumers, and help to make data more accessible and more relevant by giving users a view of the catalog tailored to their particular interests.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"width: 200px; height: 209px; padding-right: 20px; float: left;\" title=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/bsp-ocsit-prod-east-appdata\/datagov\/wordpress\/2013\/10\/images\/opendata_20110705_4.jpg\" alt=\"a screenshot of the Energy.data.gov webpage\" height=\"209\" width=\"200\">On June 30, 2011, we launched our latest community, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.data.gov\/communities\/energy\">Energy.Data.gov<\/a>.&nbsp; The Energy Community is aimed at increasing awareness and improving insight into our Nation\u2019s energy performance, bringing together datasets, tools, and applications using data about energy and how it is used.&nbsp; Data about alternative fuels, energy efficient buildings, and how to conserve energy at home are available to empower Americans to understand energy issues, including the energy use of the federal government.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>These new innovations are a challenge as we have experienced dramatic cuts to the eGov fund and the Data.gov budgets.&nbsp; However, in a new paradigm, these communities and some additional services are moving forward because of reimbursements from agencies that support the initiatives and goals of these new communities.&nbsp; Stay tuned as the Data.gov team, working with other agencies, brings up new communities that focus on the interests of the American public.<\/p>\n<h3>Geospatial Integration is Coming Soon<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"width: 700px; height: 266px;\" title=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/bsp-ocsit-prod-east-appdata\/datagov\/wordpress\/2013\/10\/images\/opendata_20110705_5.jpg\" alt=\"popular maps from geodata.gov\" height=\"266\" width=\"700\"><\/p>\n<p>This summer, we will merge Geospatial One Stop (geodata.gov) into Data.gov to consolidate the Federal government\u2019s two primary data catalogs into one site. Bringing the two sites into one will simplify citizens&#8217; search for data, whether geospatial or tabular, while still providing the same visualization (e.g. mapping) capabilities that currently exist at Geospatial One Stop. The consolidation will also save money by eliminating the need for the technical infrastructure of an independent Geospatial One Stop, and by providing citizens and agencies alike with a single source for all federal civilian geospatial data.<\/p>\n<h3>The Future is Bright<\/h3>\n<p>In the next several months, Data.gov will continue to transform and grow.&nbsp; Additional Communities are in development, and Data.gov Next Generation will host more and more of the federal agencies\u2019 datasets, so that the government\u2019s data is available in a format that is more useful to citizens, researchers and developers.&nbsp; As Data.gov continues to improve, it will maintain its position as a world leader in open government data.&nbsp; Be part of this journey\u2014explore the data, share what you learn, and help to deliver the power of understanding through visualizations, apps, and analyses.<\/p>\n<h3>Thanks for the Memories<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"width: 300px; height: 200px; padding-left: 20px; float: right;\" title=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/bsp-ocsit-prod-east-appdata\/datagov\/wordpress\/2013\/10\/images\/opendata_20110705_6-1.jpg\" alt=\"Federal CIO Vivek Kundra presenting a letter of appreciation to Sonny Bhagowalia\" height=\"200\" width=\"300\">I would like to thank everyone who attended my Hawaiian-themed farewell party for their kind words and best wishes. The event was a wonderful send-off, and I am grateful for the appearance by the Federal CIO, Vivek Kundra, as well as other Department and Agency CIOs who attended.<\/p>\n<p>In my time as Data.gov Program Executive, I have had an incredible team of over-achievers supporting me \u2013 they are the real heroes and heroines of Data.gov and the Open Gov movement. Marion Royal, Hyon Kim, Alan Vandermallie, and Sally Kiel from GSA, Joey Hutcherson from Commerce, George Thomas from HHS, and Jeanne Holm from NASA have all been key to the success of Data.gov and it has been my pleasure to have worked with each of them. Dr. Jim Hendler from the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and Nick Harrigan, Hiko Naito, and the rest of our contractor team have been superb and provided world-class support. It\u2019s been great to be part of the Data.gov team and the global Open Government phenomenon.<\/p>\n<p>Aloha and Mahalo!<br \/>Sonny<\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<h3>Aloha!<\/h3>\n<p><img alt=\"Sonny Bhagowalia at his farewell party\" src=\"\/media\/2013\/10\/opendata_20110705_1_1.jpg\" style=\"width: 180px; height: 189px; padding-left: 20px; float: right; \" title=\"\" \/>This will be my final blog entry as Program Executive for Data.gov, as I am departing to become the Chief Information Officer for the State of Hawaii.
