Harvard studied Data.gov to better understand Federal CIO Vivek Kundra\u2019s groundbreaking ideas behind it:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-position: outside; margin-left: 30px;\">\n<li>Move government data to the web<\/li>\n<li>Make data available in raw, machine-readable format<\/li>\n<li>Encourage people to use the data<\/li>\n<li>Harness the wisdom of crowds beyond government to drive innovation<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>What was the result? BETTER GOVERNMENT!<\/p>\n<p>The HBS case study pulls together the best history\u2014word that seems slightly pretentious since we have barely celebrated our first anniversary\u2014of Data.gov from the major players. We have accomplished much in the past year: hosting more than 300,000 datasets, launching apps competitions based on the data, and encouraging use of the data by researchers, developers and the greater public&#8211;\u201cputting the data to work\u201d is how we like to describe it.\u00a0 However, the HBS assessment of the way forward is what excites me most.<\/p>\n<p>The HBS case study brings in voices from across the open government data environment, including Ellen Miller from the Sunlight Foundation, Tim O\u2019Reilly of O\u2019Reilly Media, Dave Campbell of Microsoft, along with those of the U.S. Federal government, to discuss Data.gov\u2019s challenges and opportunities. We are in new, uncharted territory. How do we make the most data available while maintaining individual privacy and security? How do we find and assemble a community of experts to create best practices in using U.S. government data? We feel that the recent conference was a big step in this direction.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s time to take the open data movement to the next level\u2014we need to create the international communities, topics, and focus areas that need to be addressed as a global community.\u00a0 I encourage you to read this case study and contact me with your ideas\u2014let me know what you\u2019re doing so we can move forward together.<\/p>\n<h3>Stay involved and tuned\u2014new communities of data are coming \u2026<\/h3>\n<p>Join in the discussions in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.data.gov\/opendata\">open data<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.data.gov\/semantic\">semantic<\/a> communities and stay tuned as new communities in health, economics, climate, and law come to life in the next quarter of fiscal year 2011\u2026.<\/p>\n<p>Many on our team will take some much-needed leave this month after working assiduously and continuously for a long while \u2013 we shall all re-emerge re-charged, renewed and rejuvenated in 2011!\u00a0 I wish all of you a safe, joyous, and prosperous Holiday Season!\u00a0 \u00a0Let good data set you free \u2026<\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important;
