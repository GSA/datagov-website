The <a href=\"http:\/\/cleanwebhack.com\/hackathon\/\">CleanWeb Hackathon<\/a> recently held in San Francisco brought together a diverse array of engineers, data providers, start-ups, designers, and investors to see what kind of useful apps could be created around energy and environment data over the course of a weekend. One-hundred and seventy-five people signed up for 100 spots, including a specialist from our own EPA Region 9 office, to innovate across 60 different <a href=\"http:\/\/cleanwebhack.com\/hackathon\/datasets\/\">data sets<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Despite it being a separate event from Apps for the Environment, multiple developers who participated also submitted to our challenge. This was a big step toward building a sustainable relationship between EPA, the Department of Energy, and developers.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you all for your continued participation, and remember, you can still vote for Popular Choice App for the Environment until Oct. 7 &ndash; make your voice heard, join our community as a supporter, and let us know how we can work together better as we bring innovation from your ideas to the palms of hands.<\/p>\n<p>Robin L.
