Like the Roundtable we hosted with the White House and the Department of Commerce in June, this event was designed to promote a dialogue between government agencies that supply data and the companies and organizations that use it. The ultimate goal of all our Roundtables is to make open government data more relevant, accessible, and actionable.<span id=\"more-53480\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p>While it may be a few weeks before all the suggestions from last Friday\u2019s Open Data Roundtable at USDA are compiled into a report, companies and USDA officials came away with a better understanding of how public data is gathered, disseminated and processed by users.\u00a0 The meeting was part of a series of discussions initiated by USDA.\u00a0 Undersecretary and Chief Scientist Cathie Woteki, Deputy Undersecretary Ann Bartuska and Chief Information Officer (CIO) Cheryl Cook listened to and participated in discussions aimed at making it easier for crop, weather, soil and other information gathered by USDA to be provided to those who need it, here in America and abroad.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the recommendations made by the group during two breakout sessions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Things change, so develop an ongoing dialogue between users and providers of the data. Reach out to users (customers) to determine <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.usda.gov\/2014\/08\/05\/local-regional-data-added-to-usda-market-news\/\">what they value and what they use<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Standardize data across sets so that, for example, the definition of something as simple as \u201ccorn\u201d is universal.<\/li>\n<li>Develop a better system to enable a searcher to get what he or she wants without having to sort through reams of data first.<\/li>\n<li>Have a \u201ccrosscut\u201d system to keep users from having to go to multiple agencies or places for portions of the data they need.\u00a0 Provide \u201cone stop\u201d service.<\/li>\n<li>Provide better service to those who request information under the Freedom of Information Act.<\/li>\n<li>Standardize tables to make it easier for business to convert raw data into information it needs.<\/li>\n<li>Create a \u201cdata concierge\u201d to assist users, improve the search function of @data.gov.<\/li>\n<li>Set long terms improvement goals and develop a roadmap to get there.\u00a0 Improve geospatial data and make it the \u201chighest quality possible.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>Build an app that provides a \u201creal time\u201d data alert system, which could also be employed by USDA and other government departments to share information with the public during times of crisis or disaster.<\/li>\n<li>Leverage data that is already available, such as drought monitoring and let it be used for expanded purposes, such as predictive analysis to drive efficiencies and insight to create a smarter \u201cAgriBusiness\u201d.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The White House recognized the value of the Open Data Roundtables in the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/obamawhitehouse.archives.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/microsites\/ostp\/us_open_data_action_plan.pdf\">U.S. Open Data Action Plan<\/a>, released on May 9, 2014, which described the Roundtables as helping to \u201csupport innovators and improve open data based on feedback.\u201d The Plan notes that \u201cSpecific, actionable feedback from these sessions [the Roundtables] and others has the potential to improve descriptions, formats, and accessibility of government data.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At the conclusion of the meeting, Dr. Woteki pledged to continue her effort to provide more, free access to USDA\u2019s scholarship and data.\u00a0 She noted that these efforts build on an Open Data event spearheaded by the G-8 countries at the World Bank over a year ago, and continued this week as African leaders from many nations came to Washington to discuss agricultural and other issues.\u00a0 \u201cAgriculture has a growing role in open data implementation, because we face a growing challenge to produce more food for more people, and to provide the services they expect,\u201d said Dr. Woteki. \u201cThe only way to achieve this is through collaborative work, innovation sharing, and research.\u201d\u00a0 USDA CIO Cook talked about how data was crucial to her previous jobs with the State of Pennsylvania, then as a Federal official in the Clinton and Obama administrations.\u00a0 \u201cAs someone who has been a data producer and a data user,\u201d said Cook, \u201cI understand the need to consolidate data so it can be used for multiple purposes to help our clients achieve their goals. We support public-private partnerships, open data and the need to know who is using our data and how, so we can serve them better.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Originally posted at <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.usda.gov\/2014\/08\/07\/participants-in-open-data-roundtables-guide-usda-on-ways-to-provide-high-quality-data-to-users\/\">USDA.gov.<\/a><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important;
