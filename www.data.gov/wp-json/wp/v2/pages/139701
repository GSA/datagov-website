Alternative approaches to building infrastructure, such as ecosystem-based adaptation, are necessary as part of an overall strategy for creating resilient human communities in the face of climate change. Coastal Resilience was developed to help practitioners and stakeholders understand how they can make informed decisions about marine and coastal conservation, land protection, and coastal development, and implement ecosystem-based adaptation strategies. Coastal Resilience helps users visualize future conditions so they can design, build, and discuss alternative future scenarios that address sea level rise, storm surge, social and ecological vulnerability, and conservation priorities.<\/dd>\n<dt>How it works:<\/dt>\n<dd>The Coastal Resilience project delivers geospatial information on coastal ecosystems, socioeconomics, community vulnerability, and coastal hazards (including sea level rise and storm surge) via an internet mapping application that is a data viewer, data discovery tool, and a future scenario mapper. Coastal Resilience also includes a summary tool for calculating economic and ecological loss in specific geographies within the study area given different future scenarios.

Ecosystem-Based Management (EBM) is an innovative management approach to address these challenges. It considers the whole ecosystem, including humans and the environment, rather than managing one issue or resource in isolation. The EBM Tools Network is an alliance of EBM tool users, providers, and researchers to promote the use and development of tools for EBM in coastal and marine environments and the terrestrial environments that affect them. The EBM Tools Database provides the most comprehensive source of information about tools and other resources for EBM.<\/dd>\n<dt>How it works:<\/dt>\n<dd>Users can search or browse the database to find tools for their coastal and marine management and conservation projects, case studies of projects that have used tools, potential collaborators, and other resources. They can also contribute information about their own tools, projects, and expertise. Use is completely free.<\/dd>\n<dt>Application:<\/dt>\n<dd>EBM tools are software or other highly documented methods that can help implement EBM by providing models of ecosystems or key ecosystem processes; generating scenarios illustrating the consequences of different management decisions on natural resources and the economy; and facilitating stakeholder involvement in planning processes.<\/dd>\n<\/dl>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"modal-footer\"><button class=\"btn btn-default\" type=\"button\" data-dismiss=\"modal\">Close<\/button><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/li>\n<li><a title=\"Extreme Water Levels\" data-toggle=\"modal\" data-target=\"#tools-t15\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Extreme Water Levels<\/a>: Provides annual and monthly exceedance probability levels for select Center for Operational and Oceanographic Products and Services water level stations with at least 30 years of data.\n<div id=\"tools-t15\" class=\"modal fade\" style=\"padding: 0 10px;\" tabindex=\"-1\">\n<div class=\"modal-dialog\">\n<div class=\"modal-content\">\n<div class=\"modal-header\">\n<p><button class=\"close\" type=\"button\" data-dismiss=\"modal\">\u00d7<\/button><\/p>\n<h4 id=\"gridSystemModalLabel\" class=\"modal-title\">Extreme Water Levels<\/h4>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"modal-body\">\n<dl>\n<dt>Sponsor:<\/dt>\n<dd>NOAA<\/dd>\n<dt>Name:<\/dt>\n<dd>Extreme Water Levels<\/dd>\n<dt>URL:<\/dt>\n<dd><a href=\"http:\/\/tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov\/est\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" name=\"tools-t1\">http:\/\/tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov\/est\/<\/a><\/dd>\n<dt>Summary:<\/dt>\n<dd>Extremely high or low water levels at coastal locations are an important public concern and a factor in coastal hazard assessment, navigational safety, and ecosystem management. .<\/dd>\n<dt>How it works:<\/dt>\n<dd>When used in conjunction with real time station data, exceedance probability levels can be used to evaluate current conditions and determine whether a rare event is occurring.<\/dd>\n<dt>Application:<\/dt>\n<dd>This information may also be instrumental in planning for the possibility of dangerously high or low water events at a local level.
