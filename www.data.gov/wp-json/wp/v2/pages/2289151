The full NEX-DCP30 dataset covers the historical period (1950-2005) and 21st century (2006-2099) under four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) emission scenarios developed for AR5. The USGS National Climate Change Viewer (NCCV) includes the historical and future climate projections from 30 of the CMIP5 models, downscaled to an 800-m grid over the continental United States under the NASA NEX-DCP30 project, for two of the RCP emission scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). USGS has also used the downscaled temperature and precipitation data from these 30 CMIP5 models as input to a simple water-balance model to simulate changes in the surface water balance (snow water equivalent, runoff, soil water storage and evaporative deficit) over the historical and future time periods on the 800-m CONUS grid. Combining the climate data with the water balance data in the NCCV provides further insights into the potential for climate-driven change in water resources. The NCCV shows averages of the climate and water balance data over four climatology periods: 1950-2005, 2025-2049, 2050-2074, and 2075-2099. The viewer provides a number of useful tools for characterizing climate change including maps, climographs (plots of monthly averages), histograms that show the distribution or spread of the model simulations, monthly time series spanning 1950-2099, and tables that summarize changes in the quantiles (median and extremes) of the variables. The application also provides access to comprehensive, summary reports in PDF format and CSV files of the temperature and precipitation data for each geographic area.<\/dd>\n<\/dl>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"modal-footer\">\n                        <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-default\" data-dismiss=\"modal\">Close<\/button><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/li>\n<li><a data-toggle=\"modal\" data-target=\"#portals-p6\" title=\"Regional Climate Change Viewer (RCCV)\" href=\"#portals-p6\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Regional Climate Change Viewer (RCCV)<\/a>: Tool to visualize dynamically downscaled GCM results\n<div id=\"portals-p6\" style=\"padding: 0 10px;\" class=\"modal fade\" tabindex=\"-1\">\n<div class=\"modal-dialog\">\n<div class=\"modal-content\">\n<div class=\"modal-header\">\n          <button type=\"button\" class=\"close\" data-dismiss=\"modal\" aria-label=\"Close\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\">\u00d7<\/span><\/button><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"modal-title\" id=\"gridSystemModalLabel\">Regional Climate Change Viewer (RCCV)<\/h4>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"modal-body\">\n<dl>\n<dt>Sponsor:<\/dt>\n<dd>USGS\/Oregon State Univ.<\/dd>\n<dt>Name:<\/dt>\n<dd>Regional Climate Change Viewer (RCCV)<\/dd>\n<dt>URL:<\/dt>\n<dd><a href=\"http:\/\/regclim.coas.oregonstate.edu\/visualization\/rccv\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" name=\"portals-p6\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http:\/\/regclim.coas.oregonstate.edu\/visualization\/rccv\/index.html<\/a><\/dd>\n<dt>Summary:<\/dt>\n<dd>The Regional Climate Change Viewer (RCCV) allows a user to visualize model output from the Dynamical Downscaling project as averages of model grid cell values over selected bounding polygons.

Scenarios are ways to help understand what future conditions might be, with each scenario an example of what might happen under different assumptions. Scenarios generally blend both model output and other information, such as observed trends. They are not predictions or forecasts, and no probabilities are associated with them. Instead, they provide a range of future conditions to bound uncertainty. The scenarios accessed through scenarios.globalchange.gov include climate change, sea level change, and land use and population change. They are based on peer-reviewed, published sources and were used in the development of the National Climate Assessment, which provides scientific findings about climate change and its impacts on U.S. regions and key socioeconomic sectors.<\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important;
