Given a need to develop resilience strategies based on an uncertain future, many experts look to past climate extremes for information to help guide and constrain decision-making.

The FEWS model provided estimates of consumption at approximately 400 power plants in the U.S. for 2010. Based on FEWS, withdrawal and consumption of water by thermoelectric power plants in the United States for 2010 are described in the associated report, which can be accessed at <a href=\"http:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/sir\/2013\/5188\/\">http:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/sir\/2013\/5188\/<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Groundwater depletion in the United States (1900\u22122008)<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/pubs.er.usgs.gov\/publication\/sir20135079\" target=\"_blank\">Groundwater depletion in the United States (1900\u22122008)<\/a><\/p>\n<p>A natural consequence of groundwater withdrawals is the removal of water from subsurface storage, but the overall rates and magnitude of groundwater depletion in the United States are not well characterized. This study evaluates long-term cumulative depletion volumes in 40 separate aquifers or areas and one land use category in the United States, bringing together information from the literature and from new analyses. Depletion is directly calculated using calibrated groundwater models, analytical approaches, or volumetric budget analyses for multiple aquifer systems. Estimated groundwater depletion in the United States during 1900\u20132008 totals approximately 1,000 cubic kilometers (km3). Furthermore, the rate of groundwater depletion has increased markedly since about 1950, with maximum rates occurring during the most recent period (2000\u20132008) when the depletion rate averaged almost 25 km3 per year (compared to 9.2 km3 per year averaged over the 1900\u20132008 timeframe).

Many State, Federal, and Tribal agencies make routine observations of the water cycle. This website graphically visualizes these data to help understand the effect of drought on rivers, streams, lakes, and reservoirs.
