Nonetheless, Americans still suffer undiagnosed, undertreated, or untreated mental-health challenges and invisible illnesses (e.g., traumatic brain injuries, chronic pain, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, Lyme disease) that can lead to depression and increase risk for suicide. To combat this, The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) will showcase government open datasets and APIs being used to strengthen awareness of mental illness, identify new opportunities for treatment, and strengthen communities for improved patient outcomes. Data scientists, designers, and innovators from across the country are co-creating human-centered design focused tools with mental health professionals and medical practitioners.\u00a0This session will include next-gen technology demos by: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.crisistextline.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Crisis Text Line<\/a>, New York, NY; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bayesimpact.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Bayes Impact<\/a>, San Francisco, CA; and Harvard University collaboration with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.media.mit.edu\/\" target=\"_blank\">MIT Media Lab<\/a>, Cambridge, MA. Session concludes with panel discussion, connecting innovators with suicide-prevention experts.
