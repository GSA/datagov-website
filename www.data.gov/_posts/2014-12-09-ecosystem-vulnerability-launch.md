Today, the Ecosystem Vulnerability theme page was unveiled during the Plenary Session of the ACES (A Community on Ecosystem Services) conference near Washington, D.C. The Ecosystem Vulnerability theme was formally launched, along with the Water theme, and the Data.gov Ecosystems community (Ecosystems.data.gov), by Interior Secretary Sally Jewell. The new Ecosystem Vulnerability theme of climate.data.gov provides a variety of data and resources to foster greater understanding of the impacts of climate change on water resources, biodiversity, the extent of invasive species, the ability of our ecosystems to sequester carbon, and the frequency and extent of wildland fires.
