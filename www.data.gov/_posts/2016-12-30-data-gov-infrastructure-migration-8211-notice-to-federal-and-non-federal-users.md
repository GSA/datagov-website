  Users

Data.gov recently completed migration to a new infrastructure. The change will make the Data.gov program more efficient and enable development of new capabilities for site users.


For most users of Data.gov, there should be no impact. For users of Data.gov, Geoplatform.gov and inventory.data.gov with  access to edit web page content, harvest metadata records, or manage metadata records, there are some important changes in the new infrastructure, in particular the integration of Data.gov with [OMB MAX](https://max.omb.gov/maxportal/home.do) for account login authentication, as described in more detail below:


**Data.gov (WordPress):**


All users who have accounts on Data.gov and signed on previously through <http://idp.geoplatform.gov> will now use [OMB MAX login](https://login.max.gov/cas/login?service=https%3A%2F%2Fmax.gov%2Fmaxportal%2Fsa%2Flogin.action%3Bjsessionid%3D994E6FE4CC968B89D599672C9F9DDAAE). If you have an account on Data.gov to modify content on the main Data.gov page or a topic page, you will be sent to OMB MAX upon your first login. You should [log in to OMB MAX](https://login.max.gov/cas/login?service=https%3A%2F%2Fmax.gov%2Fmaxportal%2Fsa%2Flogin.action%3Bjsessionid%3D994E6FE4CC968B89D599672C9F9DDAAE) with your OMB MAX credentials on your first use of the “new” Data.gov. Two-factor authentication (2FA) is now required for Data.gov access, so enable 2FA through the instructions on the OMB MAX log in page. You can add a device by clicking on “Manage SMS 2-Factor Devices” under your profile settings. This is not necessary if you use your PIV/CAC card to log in to MAX; it is already considered 2FA. After you have logged in to OMB MAX, email us at [datagov@gsa.gov](mailto:datagov@gsa.gov) to let us know that you have completed the initial login. In the email provide the Topic name and access permission (Admin or Editor) required. We will then associate requested permissions to your account. On subsequent logins to Data.gov (through OMB MAX), you should be able to perform the actions you have privileges for on Data.gov without further assistance.


**Data.gov (Catalog – CKAN)** 


Data.gov accounts for managing the Data.gov catalog (CKAN) are mainly for users who need to manage Data.gov harvest sources other than agency data.json files. For federal agencies with established data.json harvest sources for their metadata, there is no need for an account to manage the Data.gov catalog. If you have ad hoc needs, for example to conduct a manual harvest of your agency’s data.json outside of the usual nightly harvest schedule, just contact the Data.gov team at [datagov@gsa.gov](mailto:datagov@gsa.gov).


For Data.gov users with accounts to manage the Data.gov catalog (mainly geospatial harvest sources), the Data.gov login that previously used <http://idp.geoplatform.gov> will now use [OMB MAX login](https://login.max.gov/cas/login?service=https%3A%2F%2Fmax.gov%2Fmaxportal%2Fsa%2Flogin.action%3Bjsessionid%3D994E6FE4CC968B89D599672C9F9DDAAE). You will be sent to OMB MAX on your first login, you should [log in to OMB MAX](https://login.max.gov/cas/login?service=https%3A%2F%2Fmax.gov%2Fmaxportal%2Fsa%2Flogin.action%3Bjsessionid%3D994E6FE4CC968B89D599672C9F9DDAAE) using your OMB MAX credentials on your first use of the “new” Data.gov catalog. Two-factor authentication (2FA) is now required for Data.gov access, so enable 2FA through the instructions on the OMB MAX log in page. You can add a device by clicking on “Manage SMS 2-Factor Devices” under your profile settings. This is not necessary if you use your PIV/CAC card to log in to MAX; it is already considered 2FA. After you have logged in to OMB MAX, email us at [datagov@gsa.gov](mailto:datagov@gsa.gov) to let us know that you have completed the initial login. In the email provide the organization name and access permission (Admin or Editor) that is required. We will then associate requested permissions to your account. On subsequent logins to Data.gov (through OMB MAX), you should be able to perform the actions you have privileges for on the Data.gov catalog without further assistance.


If you have an urgent need for a change to your harvest source/schedule during the first several days post migration, please contact [datagov@gsa.gov](mailto:datagov@gsa.gov) and we will make the changes for you.


**Geoplatform.gov users (Website only)**


The Data.gov migration and authentication changes only affect Geoplatform.gov users who manage harvest sources for the Geoplatform.gov data catalog through <http://catalog.data.gov>.  If you have permissions to use Geoplatform.gov for any other purpose, there is no change to your login through <http://idp.geoplatform.gov>. If you have questions regarding [Geoplatform.gov](http://Geoplatform.gov), contact [servicedesk@geoplatform.gov](mailto:servicedesk@geoplatform.gov).


If you manage harvest sources for the data catalog at Geoplatform.gov, please refer to the instructions for Data.gov catalog users above and follow the same instructions for logging in through OMB MAX. If you don’t have access to OMB MAX- see the section below on obtaining access.


**Inventory.data.gov** 


Inventory.data.gov is the non-public system provided by the Data.gov team, mainly to assist federal agencies in managing their metadata for inclusion in the Data.gov catalog. Agency users have access to and are able to manage their own agency’s metadata only. Logins to use inventory.data.gov are also now integrated with OMB MAX. Log in on inventory.data.gov will now take you to [OMB MAX login](https://login.max.gov/cas/login?service=https%3A%2F%2Fmax.gov%2Fmaxportal%2Fsa%2Flogin.action%3Bjsessionid%3D994E6FE4CC968B89D599672C9F9DDAAE). You should log in to OMB MAX using your OMB MAX credentials on your first use of inventory.data.gov post migration. Two-factor authentication (2FA) is now required, so enable 2FA through the instructions on the [OMB MAX log in](https://login.max.gov/cas/login?service=https%3A%2F%2Fmax.gov%2Fmaxportal%2Fsa%2Flogin.action%3Bjsessionid%3D994E6FE4CC968B89D599672C9F9DDAAE) page. You can add a device by clicking on “Manage SMS 2-Factor Devices” under your profile settings. This is not necessary if you use your PIV/CAC card to log in to MAX; it is already considered 2FA. After you have logged in to OMB MAX, email us at [datagov@gsa.gov](mailto:datagov@gsa.gov) to let us know you have completed the initial login, in the email provide the organization name and access permission (Admin or Editor) required. We will then associate requested permissions to your account. On subsequent logins to inventory.data.gov (through OMB MAX), you should be able to use inventory.data.gov to manage metadata as previously without further assistance.


**Don’t have an OMB MAX Account?**


If you are a federal government employee or a federal government contractor with a .gov email, you can [self register](https://max.gov/maxportal/registrationForm.action) for an OMB MAX account.


For non-federal users (mainly managing non-federal harvest sources for Geoplatform.gov through <http://catalog.data.gov> ), you can obtain OMB MAX access through a federal sponsorship process. This is a relatively new process for OMB MAX that we will be working on with the federal sponsors on the Geoplatform.gov side.  We will be refining this process in the next few weeks so that federal contacts can sponsor/add non-federal users for OMB MAX more easily. Please contact [servicedesk@geoplatform.gov](mailto:servicedesk@geoplatform.gov).


Thanks for your patience as we complete the Data.gov migration questions and for your understanding on any initial glitches. Contact us at [datagov@gsa.gov](mailto:datagov@gsa.gov) with any other questions.
