**Until November 9, 2013, search results on Next.Data.gov and data.gov may differ.**


*Why?*On May 9, 2013, President Obama issued an Executive Order (and OMB issued an accompanying policy memo) making “open” the new default for non-sensitive federal government data.


Before this shift, agency representatives would log on to a central database at Data.gov and enter information about the datasets they wanted to make public. All of these dataset entries are preserved and you can search them on Data.gov today – but no new datasets will appear on Data.gov until November 9, 2013.


Going forward, federal agencies need to maintain their own data inventory listings at *agency*.gov/data by November 9, 2013. Starting November 9, Data.gov will regularly crawl all of these inventory listings to power one central search engine at Data.gov, eliminating the manually-updated central database. **Until this transition point, all crawled agency inventory listings will be searchable at Next.Data.gov.** As agencies bring their new data inventory listings online and/or add new dataset listings, they will appear on Next.Data.gov (and *not* on Data.gov).


On November 9, 2013, Next.Data.gov will become the new Data.gov.


As we get closer to November 9, more and more agencies will have their data catalogs up, and we anticipate that every agency catalog will include all of the datasets originally listed on Data.gov as well as newly-listed data. In other words, the closer we get to November 9, the more robust the search results on Next.Data.gov will become.


Until November 9, we recommend searching *both* Data.gov and Next.Data.gov for the most comprehensive results.
