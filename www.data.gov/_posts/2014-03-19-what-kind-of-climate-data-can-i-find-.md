title: What Kind of Climate Data Can I Find?
type: post
---
In this emerging climate data resource, you can find datasets and web services, as well as tools, related to coastal flooding and sea level rise. We are featuring key resources to help you get started building data layers and tools on this area of climate impact at the [resources](https://www.data.gov/climate/climate-resources) section.


Using the [data](http://catalog.data.gov/dataset?groups=climate5434&_groups_limit=0), [tools](/climate/climate-tools), and [maps](/climate/hurricanes-tropical-storms/) tabs, you can find more datasets related to [coastal flooding risks to communities](https://www.data.gov/coastalflooding/). If you are an entrepreneur or innovator looking for a problem to solve, visit the [challenges](/climate/climate-challenges).


Here you can find datasets related to coastal flooding risks to communities. In the coming months, we’ll feature datasets, services, and tools related to:


* Climate change and human health
* Vulnerability of food systems to climate change
* Vulnerability of the energy supply to climate change
* Vulnerability of ecosystems
* …and more


Your input will help make Climate.Data.gov as useful as possible—please share your [feedback](/climate/climate-feedback/).
