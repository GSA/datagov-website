***Using Participatory GIS to Map Ocean Uses in the Mid-Atlantic***  

Thursday, May 1, 2014 from 2 to 3 p.m. Eastern


Presenter(s): Mimi D’Iorio (National Oceanic and Atmospheric  

Administration), Laura McKay (Virginia Coastal Zone Management Program),  

Nick Meade (Virginia Coastal Zone Management Program), Jeanne Herb (Rutgers  

University)


Description: Understanding human uses of the ocean is essential to successful marine  

planning. Unfortunately, spatial data on ocean uses are often limited and  

difficult to capture consistently over large areas. Participatory  

geographic information system (PGIS) processes provide interactive ways to  

capture local knowledge and ocean use patterns through specialized GIS  

mapping tools. NOAA has been working with partners all over the country to  

apply this method at local and regional scales. This webinar will be a  

panel discussion with NOAA and its partners in the mid-Atlantic region  

focused on the process, data, and lessons learned.


In this webinar, participants will:


– Learn about the NOAA PGIS method for capturing ocean use data and  

where it has been applied;  

– Hear insights from the mid-Atlantic team that has taken the process  

from one state to the entire region for marine planning applications; and  

– Gain a better understanding about the data, products, and often  

unexpected outcomes of PGIS projects.
