###### 


(April 7th 2015) The U.S. Government has released a collection of datasets to help individuals and communities plan for the impacts of climate change on the public’s health. These resources can help answer a number of relevant questions, including:


* In what ways does the changing climate affect public health where I live?
* What risk factors make individuals or communities more vulnerable to climate-related health effects?
* How can public health agencies, communities, and individuals plan for uncertain future conditions?
