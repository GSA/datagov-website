**Monitoring the US Ocean and Great Lakes Economy**


Wednesday, June 4, 2014


2:00 – 3:00pm EST


Presenter(s): Jeff Adkins and Linwood Pendleton


A lot of people’s livelihoods depend on the resources of the oceans and Great Lakes. Economics: National Ocean Watch (ENOW) is the only nationally consistent data set that is focused on monitoring the ocean and Great Lakes economy. These time-series data report the establishments, employment, wages, and gross domestic product for six ocean-dependent sectors. ENOW provides data for about 400 counties, 30 coastal states, 8 regions, and the nation. This webinar will be an interactive dialogue between Duke University Nicholas Institute scholar Linwood Pendleton and NOAA economist Jeff Adkins. They will be sharing highlights and data development methods, related international efforts, and ways in which the data can be used to improve coastal and ocean management.


In this webinar, participants will:


* Get an overview of ENOW data and methods
* Understand the value of the U.S. ocean and Great Lakes economy
* Learn how to apply data for coastal and ocean management
