[![Third U.S. National Action Plan](https://bsp-ocsit-prod-east-appdata.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/datagov/wordpress/2015/10/OpenGov1.png)](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/final_us_open_government_national_action_plan_3_0.pdf)Data.gov is proud to announce its role in supporting commitments in the third [U.S. Open Government National Action Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/10/27/advancing-open-and-citizen-centered-government) (NAP) under the [Open Government Partnership](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/) (OGP), announced today at the [OGP Summit](http://ogpsummit.org/) in Mexico City, Mexico. The OGP is a multilateral initiative with 66 member countries aimed at making government more open, accountable, and responsive to citizens.


Under the third National Action Plan, the United States is committed to more than 40 new or enhanced open government initiatives. Open data is a core component of open government, and Data.gov is excited to be part of the U.S. National Action Plan commitment for the third time. 


For the third NAP, Data.gov will focus on continuing efforts to improve the use of public feedback on what federal data needs to be released or made more accessible, as part of its work with agencies to implement the federal [Open Data Policy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/memoranda/2013/m-13-13.pdf). On a daily basis, Data.gov receives user feedback from Americans who rely on federal open data to advance their interests in commerce, health care, education, safety, and much more. Under the third NAP, Data.gov will work with the [Office of Management and Budget](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb) to establish user-friendly feedback mechanisms to connect data users directly to agencies, in order to ensure that agencies receive and act promptly on public requests and suggestions. In addition, Data.gov will support NAP commitments on developing national open data guidelines and making municipal data more accessible to citizens as part of the Municipal Data Network. We look forward to continuing our role in expanding access to government data and delivering on an international commitment for open government on behalf of the United States.
