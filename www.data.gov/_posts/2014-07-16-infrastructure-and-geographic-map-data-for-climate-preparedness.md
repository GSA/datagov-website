To help communities and citizens plan for the risks of coastal flooding and other climate-change-related impacts, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, and the U.S. Geological Survey have released new non-sensitive datasets containing mapping information on hundreds of thousands of the Nationâ€™s infrastructure units and geographical features. [These data](http://hsip.geoplatform.gov/arcgis/rest/services/HSIP_Public) are being made available via user-friendly mapping services on [Geoplatform.gov](http://www.geoplatform.gov/) and [Climate.data.gov](/climate).
