An annual series that provides economic data by industry and is particularly useful for studying the economic activity of small areas. The [County Business Patterns](http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/county-business-patterns/resource/2bfcc388-170b-4c60-8b41-addba3bef1d4) can also be used for analyzing economic changes over time and for businesses, is helpful for analyzing market potential, measuring the effectiveness of sales and advertising programs, setting sales quotas, and developing budgets.
