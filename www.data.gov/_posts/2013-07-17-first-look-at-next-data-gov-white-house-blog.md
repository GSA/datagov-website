Last week, President Obama [talked about the importance of opening government data to the American people](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/07/08/remarks-president-presenting-new-management-agenda), so entrepreneurs and business owners can use those troves of information to create jobs and solve problems that government can’t solve by itself. In remarks last Monday, he noted many examples of the Administration’s progress toward making that happen, saying:

  

*“At Data.gov, you can search through and download more than 75,000 data sets – data on everything from what different hospitals charge for different procedures, to credit card complaints, to weather and climate measurements.”*

  

Today, we’re excited to share a sneak preview of a new design for Data.gov, called [Next.Data.gov](http://www.data.gov/). The upgrade builds on the President’s May 2013 [Open Data Executive Order](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/09/executive-order-making-open-and-machine-readable-new-default-government-) that aims to fuse open-data practices into the Federal Government’s DNA. [Next.Data.gov](http://www.data.gov/) is far from complete (think of it as a very early beta), but we couldn’t wait to share our design approach and the technical details behind it – knowing that we need your help to make it even better.
