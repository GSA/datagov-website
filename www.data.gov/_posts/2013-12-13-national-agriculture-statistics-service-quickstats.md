Official aggregate estimates related to U.S. agricultural production. National Agriculture Statistics Service (NASS) develops these estimates from data collected through hundreds of sample surveys conducted each year covering virtually every aspect of U.S. agriculture and the Census of Agriculture conducted every five years providing state- and county-level aggregates. QuickStats is available as an [online database](http://www.quickstats.nass.usda.gov/), or you can use the [newly released API](http://www.quickstats.nass.usda.gov/api) to access the data programmatically.
