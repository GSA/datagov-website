Agriculture data is helping fuel new products, services, and apps for farmers.Â  Data in action include:


The [Climate Corporation](http://www.climate.com/) offers insurance, software, and services to help farmers plan, manage, and protect their crops by using a number of open federal government data sets, including weather history and forecasts from the National Weather Service, terrain maps and soil type from the U.S. Geological Survey, soil quality from the Natural Resources Conservation Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), crop yields from USDA, and weather and earth observation data from NASA.


[Mercaris](http://www.mercariscompany.com/) uses open data from USDA to deliver market data and online trading tools that can assist in pricing decisions for the organic and non-GMO food industry.


[FarmLogs](http://farmlogs.com/) offers analytical tools to help farmers improve on-season and off-season decision making by using several open data sets, including weather and GPS data from NOAA and pricing and news from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
