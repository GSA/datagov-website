NOAA’s Ship Tracker is a viewer tool developed by the NOS Special Projects Office (SPO) for the Office of Marine and Aviation Operations (NOAA OMAO) which shows information about the location, present and past, of NOAA’s ships. Ship location and the conditions where the ship was located are maintained on this site for one year.
