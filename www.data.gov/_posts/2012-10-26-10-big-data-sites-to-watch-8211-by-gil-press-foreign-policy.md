Data.gov, which was launched by the Obama administration as part of its [Open Government Initiative](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2009/12/16/changing-way-washington-works) in 2009, offers access to data generated by the Executive Branch of the Federal Government. Enterprising government agencies and private citizens have built on the siteâ€™s hundreds of thousands of data sets (and other sources) to help you find everything from the most [on-time flight](http://flyontime.us/) between two airports to the latest [product recalls](http://recalls.gov/).
