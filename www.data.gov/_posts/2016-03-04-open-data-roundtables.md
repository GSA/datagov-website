The 2016 Open Data Roundtables
------------------------------


The Open Data Roundtables were gatherings to identify  

case studies, lessons learned, and best practices in open data across the Federal government.


### PURPOSE


The Roundtables supported the Federal goal to responsibly unleash government data for the benefit of the American public and maximize the nation’s return on its investment in data.


### WHY OPEN DATA?


Open data from government is free, publicly-available data that anyone can use and republish. This important public resource has helped [Americans find better value for college, fair housing, and safer medicines](https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/02/05/open-data-empowering-americans-make-data-driven-decisions). In addition, it helps government agencies operate more efficiently, share information, and engage the citizens they serve.


### ABOUT THE 2016 OPEN DATA ROUNDTABLES.


Federal agencies face many obstacles in making their data as accessible and usable as possible. Agencies have been working on these goals and the Roundtables helped identify scalable solutions across the government.


The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and the Center for Open Data Enterprise hosted four Open Data Roundtables in 2016. The Roundtables were designed to achieve the following goals:


* Identify open data case studies, learned lessons, and best practices across the Federal government;
* Strengthen a community of technical, legal, and policy experts in support of open data; and
* Support continuity and accelerate the progress of open data work.


The Roundtables brought together participants from Federal agencies, academia, the private sector, and nonprofit organizations. The Roundtables included experts on all aspects of open data with technical, policy, and legal backgrounds to identify case studies, lessons learned, and best practices.
