Vessel Tracking Data Used for Ocean Planning


Monday, June 2, 2014, 3 to 4p.m. Eastern  
  
Presenters: Daniel Martin, NOAA Coastal Services Center; Stephen Creed,  
Bureau of Ocean Energy Management; Kyle Ward, NOAA Office of Coast Survey;  
Andrea Dransfield, Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary  
  
Vessel traffic data, or Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, are  
collected by the U.S. Coast Guard through an onboard navigation safety  
device that transmits and monitors the location and characteristics of  
large vessels in real time. The MarineCadastre.gov project team has worked  
with the Coast Guard and NOAA’s Office of Coast Survey to repurpose and  
make available some of the most important data for use in ocean planning  
applications. This webinar will provide an overview of the data available  
and examples of how the MarineCadastre.gov AIS data are being used,  
including scoping wind planning areas, evaluating ship anchorage areas, and  
analyzing changes to shipping lanes through a national marine sanctuary.  
  
In this webinar, participants will


* Learn about the variety of vessel-tracking data products and tools and how to access them via MarineCadastre.gov
* Gain a better understanding of how the products can be applied to a range of ocean-planning applications
