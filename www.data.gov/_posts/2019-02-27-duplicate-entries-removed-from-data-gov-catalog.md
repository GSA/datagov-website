title: Duplicate Entries Removed from Data.gov Catalog
type: post
---
In the last few days, you may have noticed a significant drop in the total number of datasets displayed on the Data.gov [catalog](https://catalog.data.gov). The decrease was not due to an actual reduction in the number of datasets, but the removal of duplicate entries for many datasets. This was not as a result of duplicates in the sources of the metadata in the Data.gov catalog (agency metadata harvest sources), but due to a problem with the Data.gov harvester. The duplicate entries were removed during the weekend of February 23-24 and archives of the duplicates have been retained to allow agencies to fully review these changes. 


Harvesting for most federal agency dataset sources occurs on a daily, automated basis. As agencies update their metadata inventories, the Data.gov catalog is updated at the next scheduled harvest. As a result, the total number of datasets on the Data.gov [catalog](https://catalog.data.gov) normally fluctuates. In the coming weeks and months, we expect to see an increase in datasets provided by a greater number of federal agencies under the recently enacted Open Government Data Act (Title II of the [Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/4174/text), Pub. L. 114-435). We will provide updates on our progress in working with the federal agencies in providing access to more federal data under the statute.
