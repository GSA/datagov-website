By guest author Irina Bolychevsky, Product Owner of CKAN, Open Knowledge Foundation


A huge milestone was reached yesterday with the relaunch of the [U.S. government data portal](http://catalog.data.gov/dataset) on a single, [open source platform](http://ckan.org/). A joint collaboration between a small UK team at the [Open Knowledge Foundation](http://okfn.org/) and data.gov, this was an ambitious project to reduce the numerous previous catalogs and repositories into one central portal for serious re-use of government open data.


 


[Catalog.data.gov](http://catalog.data.gov/dataset) brings together both geospatial as well as “raw” (tabular or text) data under a single roof in a consistent standardised beautiful interface that can be searched, faceted by fomat, publisher, community or keyword as well as filtered by location.
