The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Ports Initiative works in collaboration with the port industry, communities, and all levels of government to improve environmental performance and increase economic prosperity. This effort helps people living and working near ports across the country breathe cleaner air and live better lives. The Ports Initiative recently release an interactive map highlighting clear air practices at some of the largest ports around the United States.


The interactive map can be found at: https://www.epa.gov/ports-initiative/best-port-wide-planning-practices-improve-air-quality#clean-air


The Ports Initiative website also includes information on methods for performing an emissions inventory, a toolkit to assist community and port collaboration efforts, information on funding opportunities, and other technical resources.
