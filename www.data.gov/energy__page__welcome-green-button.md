The Green Button initiative gives utility customers easy access to their electricity usage data. This data is provided as a text file in a format that is standard across multiple utilities. This data file can then be shared with third party developers who can provide valuable context, analysis, and other functions based on that usage data. About 10-12 million customers (commercial and residential) currently have access to their data in this format, and 20-30 million are expected to have access by the end of 2012. Find out more about the Green Button from the [White House](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/administration/eop/ostp/pressroom/01182012) and at the [Department of Energy’s OpenEI.org](http://en.openei.org/wiki/Green_Button).
