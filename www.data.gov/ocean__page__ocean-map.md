Marine planners often need to consider a wide range of information about the ocean, coasts, and Great Lakes in the planning process. This information may include human uses, natural processes, living and non-living resources, jurisdictional boundaries, and much more. Interactive maps are a helpful way to visualize this information. Below you can explore some examples of maps with information used by the marine planning community. Because data sets vary in scale, we have separated these maps into two categories â€“ national and regional.
