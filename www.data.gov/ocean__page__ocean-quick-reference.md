1) Q: How do I upload metadata into Data.gov?

---------------------------------------------

A:

Federal Agencies:

Data.gov is organized into separate catalogs to provide access to three classes of published, publicly accessible federal data and related access tools and services: “raw” data, geodata and applications, each with specific distinguishing characteristics.

Although the selection criteria, approval, and submission process differ by department and agency, the following highlights the Data.gov submission process.

* Nomination of data or application
  * Although any individual or organization may suggest a dataset or application for promotion to Data.gov, primary responsibility rests with the data steward(s) responsible for its availability and management.
* Determination of suitability and initial selection
  * Initial selection of nominated datasets and/or applications depends on analysis of their suitability. Suitability is determined by meeting **all** of the criteria set forth in the [Data.gov Data Policy](http://www.data.gov/datapolicy).
* Preparation and submission of metadata
  * “Raw” data and Applications

For individual or groups of datasets and applications, a standard metadata template is available via the Data.gov Dataset Management System (DMS) at <https://dms.data.gov/> . Completed records are most often submitted by an appointed data steward.

Geodata:

Federal geodata records are entered into the geo.data.gov catalog in fully FDGC-compliant form, where they will then be “flagged” for inclusion in ocean.data.gov. For information on the appropriate metadata standard, visit the [Metadata Requirements](/ocean/data-quality-and-documentation-subpage/#metadata-requirements) section.

* Internal review and certification for publication
  * All metadata submitted through the DMS are reviewed by either the department/agency POC or the Geodata POC
* Data.gov Review and Approval
  * Publication in Data.gov is a multi-step process which requires several approvals and certifications. The following outlines the approval process:
    * Agency/Line Office and/or Geodata POC
    * Agency/Department POC
    * Data.gov Program Management Office (PMO) POC

For more information, contact your department, agency, or line office metadata steward.

Others:

Changes are currently being made to accommodate non-federal spatial data and information. The process for uploading metadata to be represented in Data.gov is in development.

2) Q: How do I publish a catalog so that my metadata becomes part of the system?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A: Metadata can be submitted and harvested through a semi-automated process or through the use of federal catalogs. The following types of catalogs are accepted by Data.gov:

* Web Accessible Folder (WAF)
  * An HTTP accessible directory of files, typically metadata files in XML format in which all files and their time-stamps are visible to a web browser or client
* Z39.50 Protocol
  * A client-server protocol used for searching and retrieving information from remote computer database, the Z39.50 protocol syntax supports the search, retrieval, sort, and browsing of information.

More information: [ANSI/NISO Z39.50 Specification](http://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency/Z39-50-2003.pdf)

* OGC OpenGIS Catalogue Service for Web (CS-W)
  * The OGC Catalog Service defines and utilizes common interfaces to discover, browse, and query metadata about data, services, and other resources. More information – [OGC Specification](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/cat)
  * Open Archives Initiative – Protocol for Metadata Harvesting
    * The Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) provides an application-independent interoperability framework based on metadata harvesting. For implementation guidelines and additional information, visit <http://www.openarchives.org/pmh/>

3) Q: Which metadata standards should be used to document my agency/organizations data holdings?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A: As described in the “How do I upload metadata into Data.gov” section above, certain metadata restrictions apply differently to “raw” data and applications and geodata. For more information on recommended metadata standards, visit the [Metadata Requirements](/ocean/data-quality-and-documentation-subpage/#metadata-requirements) section.

4) Q: How do I make my data accessible to Ocean.data.gov?

---------------------------------------------------------

A: There are two options for making your data accessible to Ocean.data.gov:

* Metadata discovery
  * Using the information and recommendations for metadata standards, available [here](/ocean/data-quality-and-documentation-subpage/#metadata-requirements), data stewards and providers should ensure that a link to the original, authoritative dataset is provided.
  * Web Services
    * Ocean.data.gov can provide direct access to web services. For information on common web mapping service standards and data publishing considerations, visit the [Data Publishing and Exchange](/ocean/data-publishing-and-exchange-subpage/) section.

5) Q: If my metadata has been submitted to and accepted by Geospatial One-Stop, will it be automatically searchable within Data.gov?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A: Yes. If your Federal dataset has been accepted by Geospatial One-Stop as well as flagged and approved through the approval/certification process (see Question above), these data should be searchable within Data.gov. If your dataset is from a non-Federal source, it is now available through [Geoplatform.gov](http://www.geoplatform.gov/).

6) Q: How can I provide input to the ocean community?

-----------------------------------------------------

A: Please visit the [Feedback form](https://www.data.gov/contact).
