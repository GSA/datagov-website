**Data.gov and Non-Federal Data Sources**

**Background:**


* Data.gov is the federal catalog established in 2009
* Federal [Open Data Policy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/memoranda/2013/m-13-13.pdf) issued in 2013 requires federal agencies to maintain comprehensive data inventories that are automatically harvested daily by the Data.gov catalog.
* Detailed guidance for federal agencies can be found at [Project Open Data](https://project-open-data.cio.gov/). The federal agencies are required to describe their datasets using a required metadata [schema](https://project-open-data.cio.gov/v1.1/schema/).
* Data.gov [catalog](http://catalog.data.gov/dataset) uses the [CKAN](http://ckan.org/) open source platform for the catalog and for harvesting the agency data sources.
* The same harvesting mechanism is used to incorporate non-federal sources. Data.gov has a [local](http://catalog.data.gov/dataset?groups=local#topic=local_navigation) section.


**For non-federal government open data sources:**


This [article](http://www.digitalgov.gov/resources/how-to-get-your-open-data-on-data-gov/) provides details on how data sources are added, with a section for [non-federal](http://www.digitalgov.gov/resources/how-to-get-your-open-data-on-data-gov/#non-federal-data) sources.


The basic requirements are:


1. A data.json that can be harvested by the Data.gov catalog, with certain minimum metadata. You can validate your data.json at [labs.data.gov](http://labs.data.gov/dashboard/validate), choose the non-federal schema v 1.1.
2. A terms of use/data policy – Data.gov needs to link to the applicable non-federal data policy to inform users that non-federal data may have different terms of use.
3. A point of contact for the non-federal source. Because we receive questions about all datasets that users find on Data.gov at our [Contact Us](http://www.data.gov/contact) page, we need a point of contact to refer questions that should be addressed by the non-federal data source.
