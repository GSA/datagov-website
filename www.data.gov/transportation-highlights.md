To help communities and individuals plan for the risks of sea level rise, heavy downpours, extreme heat, and other climate-change-related impacts, the U.S. Government is releasing today a collection of software tools, datasets and informational resources containing information useful for assessing the impacts of climate change on the transportation facilities, operations, and the transportation system.


Among the products, developed by the U.S. Department of Transportation and other agencies, are


* Tools for assembling regional downscaled climate projections containing the variables most useful to transportation engineers and planners;
* Tools for assessing relative sea-level rise, erosion risk, and flooding developed by FEMA, NOAA, USGS and USACE;
* Geospatial data on the location of US transportation networks;
* Datasets on passenger and freight movements;
* Tools for assessing the vulnerability of transportation facilities to climate change;
* Digital elevation and hydrologic datasets developed by USGS, NOAA, and other agencies;
* Case studies, methodological guidance, and archived instructional webinars.


These resources will be helpful to State and local government agencies, urban and regional planners, architects and engineers, transportation system operators, and anyone with an interest in climate change impacts.
