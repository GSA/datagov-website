SUMMARY:3rd Annual Mapathon
DESCRIPTION:You are invited to join for our 3rd Annual Mapathon at Open Gov Hub\, to learn about how we can collectively improve the delivery of health and other key public services through citizen mapping\, feedback and participation. \nWhat is a Mapathon?\nAny event that brings people together to map and create vital geographic data for humanitarian and development programs.  Participants don’t need any special expertise\, just basic computer skills and a laptop.  The objective of a mapathon is to introduce new mappers to the concept of tracing satellite imagery to create geographic data of roads\, buildings\, and other key features.  Mapathons are a unique way to focus a large group of people on a specific mapping project and introduce how humanitarian and development programs leverage geographic data to improve their effectiveness. \nWhat is MapGive? Visit our website to learn about some project highlights. \nMapGive is a State Department initiative that encourages and increases volunteer participation in the global mapping community and facilitates the creation of open geographic data to support humanitarian and development efforts. For many places in the world\, this data is incomplete or simply does not exist\, and through mapping\, volunteers can help to fill gaps in the data set to build a more sustainable future. MapGive emphasizes collaborative online mapping as a method to engage with local communities and organizations\, with resonant themes including education\, urban resilience\, and humanitarian response\, among others. Some of you may already be familiar with MapGive from previous collaborations with our team or our office’s Secondary Cities program.
