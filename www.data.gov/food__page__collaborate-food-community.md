This Food, Agriculture, and Rural Community establishes a unified point of access to data and statistics, and tools to identify relevant data sets. Providing researchers and other users of data and statistics with authoritative, high quality sources will realize greater benefits from public research, help to coordinate effort and reduce duplication in scientific investigation, and reveal new connections for innovative uses. It is hoped that this community will foster the development of new applications and tools to improve agricultural production, human health and nutrition, environmental benefits, and global food security and poverty reduction. This approach is complimentary to and in parallel with the role of science and statistical agencies that provide accurate, authoritative estimates of activities related to food and agriculture, and efforts to harmonize data and statistics with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and other international organizations.
