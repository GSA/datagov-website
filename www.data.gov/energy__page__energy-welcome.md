Energy.data.gov is a new open government initiative to increase awareness of and deepen insights into our Nationâ€™s energy performance. Energy.data.gov brings together high-value datasets, tools, and applications to shed new light on energy use. These free datasets and tools have been gathered from agencies across the Federal government with the goal of empowering all Americans to understand energy issues, including energy consumption within the Federal government.
