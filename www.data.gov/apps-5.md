There is a range of software tools available to help analyze and assess impacts of a changing climate on the water cycle. These tools provide users with convenient data access capabilities, common data transformation utilities, and analysis methods for data and related information. Please [let us know](/climate/climate-feedback/) if there are other tools that should be listed here.


* National Stormwater Calculator: EPA’s National Stormwater Calculator (SWC) is a desktop application that estimates the annual amount of rainwater and frequency of runoff from a specific site anywhere in the United States (including Puerto Rico). Estimates are based on local soil conditions, land cover, and historic rainfall records.

Summary:
EPA’s National Stormwater Calculator (SWC) is a desktop application that estimates the annual amount of rainwater and frequency of runoff from a specific site anywhere in the United States (including Puerto Rico). Estimates are based on local soil conditions, land cover, and historic rainfall records.
How it works:
The Calculator accesses several national databases that provide soil, topography, rainfall, and evaporation information for the chosen site. The user supplies information about the site’s land cover and selects the types of low impact development (LID) controls they would like to use.
Application:
It is designed to be used by anyone interested in reducing runoff from a property, including site developers, landscape architects, urban planners, and homeowners.

Summary:
Better Assessment Science Integrating Point and Nonpoint Sources (BASINS) is a multipurpose environmental analysis system designed to help regional, state, and local agencies perform watershed- and water quality-based studies.
How it works:
A geographic information system (GIS) provides the integrating framework for BASINS. GIS organizes spatial information so it can be displayed as maps, tables, or graphics. GIS allows the user to analyze landscape information and display relationships among data.
Application:
BASINS is a useful tool for those interested in watershed management, development of total maximum daily loads (TMDLs), coastal zone management, nonpoint source programs, water quality modeling, and National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NDPES) permitting.

#### Geo Data Portal

Name:
Geo Data Portal
URL:
<http://cida.usgs.gov/gdp/>
Summary:
The Geo Data Portal helps scientists and decisionmakers construct ensembles and compare climate hind casts and future projections for particular spatial areas. It helps with data management for modeling and assessing the impacts of future climate conditions.
How it works:
“The portal allows a user to process data by:  

1. selecting areas of interest by uploading a polygon  

shapefile or drawing on a map,  

2. choosing from a searchable list of historical and  

future climate datasets,  

3. selecting the variables and time period of interest  

from the dataset, and  

4. configuring processing to return raw data or spatially  

averaged summaries.”
Application:
Interest in the impacts of future climate conditions on water resources is growing. Spatially continuous representations of historical climate time-series datasets are required for calibrating hydrologic models. After calibration, climate projec tions can be applied to the model, and model outputs like soil moisture and streamflow can be produced for projected future conditions. The portal can be used to assist in generating time series of climate data, past and future, attributed to watershed polygons or other hydrologic modeling units.

<http://water.epa.gov/infrastructure/watersecurity/climate/index.cfm>
Summary:
EPA’s Climate Ready Water Utilities (CRWU) initiative assists the water sector, which includes drinking water, wastewater, and stormwater utilities, in addressing climate change impacts.
How it works:
Through the development of practical and easy-to-use tools, EPA promotes a clear understanding of climate science and adaptation options by translating complex climate projections into accessible formats. This information helps utility owners and operators better prepare their systems for the impacts of climate change.
Application:
The impacts of events such as Hurricane Sandy pose challenges to water sector utilities. Extreme weather events, sea level rise, shifting precipitation patterns and temperature variability, all intensified by climate change, have significant implications for the sustainability of the water sector. By planning for, assessing and adapting to these challenges, the water sector can fulfill their public health and environmental missions and begin the process of becoming climate ready.

Summary:
The National Water Census Data Platform, enables integration and delivery of water budget information alongside other data of interest to managers, such as water use data or ecological assessment criteria.
How it works:
End users of water budget data (i.e. management agencies and decision-makers) are be able to access an integrated online database in a form that enables them to construct local and regional water budgets.
Application:
Using the National Water Census Portal, a user can select their local watershed or stream gage and access water budget information in web visualizations or tabular data downloads. Streamflow statistics of observed and modeled daily streamflow can also be accessed.

Summary:
Exploration and Graphics for RivEr Trends (EGRET): An R-package for the analysis of long-term changes in water quality and streamflow, including the water-quality method Weighted Regressions on Time, Discharge, and Season (WRTDS)
How it works:
EGRET can obtain data from enterprise data systems or user-siupplied files. It has all of the existing WRTDS functionality – computing concentrations, fluxes, flow normalized versions of those, trends in those and graphics to show results and to explore the behavior of the data (by season, by flow class…). It has additional statistics and graphics to help evaluate the possibility that flux estimates may be biased and to evaluate historical streamflow characteristics.
Application:
WRTDS is a method of analysis for long-term surface water quality data. It is intended for use with data sets of more than about 200 observations of water quality over a time span of about 20 years or more.

Summary:
NOAA’s Weather and Climate Toolkit (WCT) is free, platform independent software distributed from NOAA’s National Climatic Data Center (NCDC). The WCT allows the visualization and data export of weather and climate data, including Radar, Satellite and Model data.
How it works:
The WCT provides tools for background maps, animations and basic filtering. The export of images and movies is provided in multiple formats. The data export feature supports conversion of data to a variety of common formats including KMZ, Shapefile, Well-Known Text, GeoTIFF, ESRI Grid and Gridded NetCDF.
Application:
The Weather and Climate Toolkit offers access to traditionally hard-to-use weather data in an accessible, visual format. If you’re someone with NOAA data but don’t know how to process it into something usable, the Weather and Climate Toolkit is a great first step to getting that data into a workable format. Likewise, if you have NOAA data and want to get it into a format you’re already familiar with, the toolkit quickly allows you to do that.
