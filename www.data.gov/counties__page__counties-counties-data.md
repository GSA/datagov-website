This page features datasets from participating counties as well as the federal government. Datasets from participating counties are not federal government data and not subject to the Data.gov Data Policy. Each county maintains its own data policy. It is important that users understand the data policies of participating countiesin order to best utilize these datasets. Federal datasets are noted with the Data.gov “world” icon and a white background. City data is noted with an icon for each county(see “Federated Domains” below) and a green background.
