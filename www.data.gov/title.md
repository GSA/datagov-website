Here you will find resources related to the impacts of climate change on the production and distribution of food. You will also find resources that show how climate change can impact international food security. Citizens, communities, businesses, and governments can use these resources to be better prepared for climate-related impacts. You may access the [framing questions](http://www.data.gov/climate/foodresilience/food-resilience-framing-questions/ "Food Resilience – framing questions") used to select the data and content available for this theme. We welcome your [feedback](https://www.data.gov/climate/climate-feedback/) on how we can make these data and resources more useful.
