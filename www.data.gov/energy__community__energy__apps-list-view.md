Interactive applications that visually display large datasets provide a portal to explore data and make discoveries. Federal agencies collect information on energy production, use, natural resources, and energy infrastructure logistics and this data can be used to create calculators, interactive maps, and other applications that leverage this data. These applications provide user communities the ability to highlight the energy issues that are occurring within their communities, aid businesses plan and analyze their proposed projects, and provide a baseline for analyzing how energy resources can be most optimally and efficiently used.


This page highlights a few of these applications, including both web-based applications and mobile apps. *When you click on the titles below, you will be leaving the Data.gov website*.
