There are a large number of government and non-government software tools available to help analyze and assess the vulnerabilities of food production and distribution systems, food safety, and international food security to changes in climate. With software tools, users can make changes in how data are shown on screen or save the data to a file, according to their needs. Please [let us know](/climate/climate-feedback/) if there are other tools that should be listed here.

CDC WONDER: Daily Air Temperatures and Heat Index
URL:
<http://wonder.cdc.gov/nasa-nldas.html>
Summary:
CDC WONDER’s North America Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) Daily Air Temperatures and Heat Index provides daily air temperature and heat Index data that are county-level daily average air temperatures and heat index measures spanning the years 1979-2010.
How it works:
Reported measures are the average temperature, number of observations, and range for the daily maximum and minimum air temperatures, and also percent coverage for the daily maximum heat index. Data are available by place (combined 48 contiguous states, region, division, state, county), time (year, month, day) and specified maximum and minimum air temperature, and heat index value.
Application:
Users can produce tables, maps, charts, and data extracts along with average temperature, the number of observations, range, and percent coverage. Data are organized into three levels of geographic detail: the 48 contiguous states, state (including multi-state regions and divisions) and county.

Summary:
The FAF provides a comprehensive national picture of freight flows, trends, and a baseline forecast to support policy studies. The FAF informs States and localities about their major trading partners and the volumes and sources of traffic passing through their jurisdictions at the corridor level.
How it works:
The FAF integrates data from a variety of sources to create a comprehensive picture of freight movement among states and major metropolitan areas by all modes of transportation. With data from the 2007 Commodity Flow Survey and additional sources, FAF provides estimates for tonnage, value, and domestic ton-miles by region of origin and destination, commodity type, and mode for 2007, the most recent year, and forecasts through 2040.
Application:
The FAF has been created to help users understand how the movement of freight affects the transportation system and where problems with the transportation system could affect the flow of freight. By combining FAF estimates with other data and models, analysts and planners can examine relationships between freight movement and congestion, economic activity, infrastructure wear, safety risk exposure, energy consumption, and environmental issues.
