* Climate Registry for the Assessment of Vulnerability (CRAVe): As more Tribal Nations complete climate adaptation plans, and begin more in-depth resource analysis, they can find existing vulnerability assessments by geographic area, assessment target, sponsoring agency, and other factors. Registered users can also enter basic information about a vulnerability assessment, enabling colleagues, partners, and others to learn and benefit from their work. Existing Tribal Nations contributions may be found in the Other Regions section of the location-based search.

* Coastal Change Analyses for Western Alaska: Interactive Map: Covering the entire extent of the Western Alaska Landscape Conservation Cooperative’s area, this analyses provide important baseline information on the distribution and magnitude of landscape changes from erosion and aggradation (deposition) over 41 years. The maps document changes in the shape and extent of land, as well as in coastal features such as spits, barrier islands, estuaries, tidal guts, and lagoons. Western Alaska Native coastal communities may use this mapping tool to summarize changes for various parcels of land or assess the extent of habitat loss or gain over the study period.

* G-WOW Guiding for Tomorrow: Changing Climate, Changing Culture: The “Gikinoo’wizhiwe Onji Waaban” (Guiding for Tomorrow) or “G-WOW” Initiative is a unique approach to increasing awareness of how climate change is affecting Lake Superior’s coastal environment, people, cultures, and economies. G-WOW integrates scientific climate change research with place-based evidence of how climate change is affecting traditional Ojibwe lifeways and people of all cultures. The Initiative brings native perspectives and involvement to addressing issues of climate change by directly engaging native communities, educators, and students, providing learners with knowledge about what they can do to mitigate or adapt to a changing climate.

* Imiq Data Portal: The word imiq means “freshwater” in the Inupiat language of Northern Alaska. The Imiq Data Portal provides a snapshot of available hydroclimate data: a map-based view shows where, what, and when data have been obtained. Users can submit a custom data query, specifying variable of interest, geographic bounds, and time step. Imiq will aggregate and export data records from multiple sources in a common format, with full metadata records that provide information about the source data.

IHIs were developed by Swinomish and Sauk-Suiattle Indian Tribes with federal partners. Tribal Nations can use this tool — which incorporates connections to ecosystem health and social/cultural beliefs — to better evaluate and manage public environmental health risks and impacts aligned with their value systems.
