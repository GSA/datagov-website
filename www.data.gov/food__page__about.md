This site is a centralized federal resource for Food, Agriculture, and Rural data. Here you will find hundreds of government [datasets](/food/data-food-community) that can help enable research, tools and decision making to improve food security; [apps](/food/page/food-apps.html) that demonstrate the power of open data for agriculture; tools for app [developers](http://usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome?navid=USDA_DEVELOPER); and opportunities to [collaborate](/food/collaborate-food-community) to learn more about Food, Agriculture and Rural data and issues.

*Secretary Vilsack kicked off the two-day G8 International Conference on Open Data for Agriculture on April 29, 2013. Vilsack launched the Food, Agriculture, and Rural virtual community saying that data ‘is one of the most important commodities in agriculture’ and sharing it openly increases its value.

This Food, Agriculture, and Rural community provides a unified point of data access and tools to identify relevant data sets. Providing researchers and other users of data with authoritative sources of high quality data will realize greater benefits from public research, help to coordinate effort and reduce duplication in scientific investigation, and reveal new connections for innovative uses. It is hoped that this community will foster the development of new applications and tools to improve agricultural production, human health and nutrition, environmental benefits, and global food security.
