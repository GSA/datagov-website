Q: Where can I learn more about Data.gov?


A: Please see the [Data.gov Frequently Asked Questions](http://www.data.gov/faq).


 


Q: Where do I go if I have general questions about climate change?


A: The focus of Climate.Data.gov is on providing data related to climate change that can help inform and prepare America’s communities, businesses, and citizens. You will find more general information about climate change and its impacts on America in the [National Climate Assessment](https://nca2018.globalchange.gov), and more information about administration plans for addressing them at the [White House](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/climate-change). You can also read an annotated description of [Executive Order 13653: Preparing the United States for the Impacts of Climate Change](https://sftool.gov/learn/annotation/427/executive-order-13653-preparing-united-states-impacts-climate-change).


 


Q: How do I get my dataset included on Climate.Data.gov?


A: Data.gov currently includes datasets from Federal agencies and from other public sector organizations. If you come from the public sector and would like to have a dataset considered, please respond to [Feedback](http://www.data.gov/climate/climate-feedback/) describing the dataset, who maintains it (including a link), and the reason why you think it would be helpful to users of Climate.Data.gov. On a selective basis, we may also expand the site to include datasets from nonprofits and private sector organizations that are critical to understanding climate change risks and impacts. If your dataset belongs in the latter category, please send details to our [Feedback](http://www.data.gov/climate/climate-feedback/) page. Our leads for each theme area of the Climate Data Initiative will be in touch.
