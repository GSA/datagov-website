#### Integrated Taxonomic Informatin System (IT IS)





Sponsor:
USGS
Name:
Integrated Taxonomic Informatin System (IT IS)
URL:
<http://www.itis.gov/tools.html>
Summary:
The ITIS database currently provides tools to compare species names with their hierarchical classifications. Agencies that typically cannot afford to maintain taxonomic data will have access to high quality taxonomic information through ITIS.
How it works:
ITIS currently includes two tools. The first is a prototype to compare taxonomy and nomenclature. The Taxonomic Workbench is a Windows-based software tool used for editing and manipulating taxonomic data for submission into the ITIS online system. This software is used for entering new data into the ITIS database, as well as updating records already in the online system.
Application:
Federal agencies have the ability to use the ITIS tool in order to promote improved coordination of efforts among federal agencies, thereby increasing productivity and saving resources.

* National Gap Analysis Program (GAP): Provides access to viewers that display data on vegetation and land use patterns, federal and state conservation lands, and species ranges.






×


#### National Gap Analysis Program (GAP)





Sponsor:
USGS
Name:
National Gap Analysis Program (GAP)
URL:
<http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/viewers/>
Summary:
The Gap Analysis Program has created interactive maps for viewing its datasets. The Land Cover Viewer displays data on vegetation and land use patterns. The PAD-US Viewer displays federal and state conservation lands. The Species Viewer displays species range.
How it works:
Using the website, users can download data or view data for vegetation and land use patterns, federal and state conservation lands and species ranges. To conduct a gap analysis, the three data layers are overlaid.
Application:
Users can map three data layers that are provided – A Gap Analysis consists of mapping three data layers — land cover, predicted distributions of vertebrate species, and a stewardship layer. This data is then assessed to determine how much of a target species’ (plant or animal) habitat is in conserved areas. From this assessment, planning decisions can be made about whether further protection is merited.

Summary:
The Climate Change Atlas documents the current and possible future distribution of 134 tree species and 147 bird species in the Eastern United States and gives detailed information on environmental characteristics defining these distributions.
How it works:
Users can see which factors (e.g. temperature, elevation, soil type) help to drive species distributions, offering some guidance on species sensitivity to large-scale climate differences. The Atlases supply maps and summary numerical data that show how the suitable habitat of each species is projected to change under three different climate models, for both high and low emissions scenarios. Maps can be viewed via the Atlas online interface, or with the program, Google Earth.
Application:
The Atlas can be used in the development of large scale projections of species responses to climate change, which can inform long-term planning.

#### LandCarbon





Sponsor:
USGS
Name:
LandCarbon
URL:
<https://www.usgs.gov/apps/landcarbon/>
Summary:
This website is a central point of data and information from the LandCarbon assessment. The LandCarbon assessment focused on changes in carbon stocks and fluxes in all the major ecosystems, and on the major natural and anthropogenic processes that control carbon cycling (such as climate change, land use, and wildland fires). The GHGs considered in this assessment were carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO, from wildland fires only), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O).  

The assessment was conducted using a methodology framework that  

1. Links land use, land management, fire disturbance, and climate data with statistical methods and process-based biogeochemical models to generate spatially and temporally explicit carbon storage and GHG flux estimates  

2. Uses remote sensing input data, existing resource and soil inventories, climate histories, and measurements made by a national network of streamgages  

3. Applies a set of future land- and climate-change scenarios to the assessment to estimate a range of carbon stocks and sequestration rates in ecosystems
How it works:
The LandCarbon datasets provide information on the changes in carbon stocks and fluxes in all the major ecosystems, and on the major natural and anthropogenic processes that control carbon cycling (such as climate change, land use, and wildland fires). Information is provided as a series of thematic maps chronicling carbon stocks and their controlling processes.
Application:
The LandCarbon project maps how much carbon is sequestered in ecosystems using stream gauge, soil, and natural-resource inventory data, remote sensing techniques, and computer models. A number of data products and visualization tools can be used to further explore the information.
