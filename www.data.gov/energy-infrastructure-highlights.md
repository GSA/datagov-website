**Electricity Information Agency’s Energy Disruptions Tool**


The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) interactive energy disruption maps combine real-time data feeds from NOAA’s National Hurricane Center with more than 20 map layers showing the nation’s energy infrastructure and resources. This new tool, available around the clock on the EIA website, allows industry, energy analysts, government decision makers, and the American public to better see and understand the potential impact of a storm. Although not strictly a climate analysis tool, such capabilities can be coupled with climate projection tools to explore future scenarios of risks and vulnerabilities.
