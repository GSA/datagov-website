### A Network of Ocean Planning Practitioners


As systems become more distributed and technology continues to evolve, the need to share information (lessons-learned, best practices, technical specifications) and provide a venue for open dialogue is paramount. The Network, through a combination of a listserv, webinar series, and informational resources, was created in response to the input received during the [Regional Data Management and Portal Design Workshop](ftp://ftp.csc.noaa.gov/incoming/abode/RegionalWorkshop/NOAA%20Reg%20Workshop_Final%20Report_08-06-12%20%281%29.pdf) held in June, 2012 in Charleston, SC and will serve as one of the main conduits for communication between state, regional, and national portals, applications, and planning efforts.


If you are interested in joining the listserv in order to stay informed of such efforts, please register by visiting link â€“ <https://csc.noaa.gov/mailman/listinfo/marine-portal-network>
