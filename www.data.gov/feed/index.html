		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) performs hydrographic surveys (hydrosurveys) for federal navigation projects around the U.S.  Federal navigation projects include an estimated 25,000 miles of channels and form a key part of U.S. maritime infrastructure in both coastal and riverine areas.  Hydrosurveys provide information about channel bathymetry which is critical for safe navigation by mariners, as well as a historical record of how channels change over time due to sediment deposition (shoaling) and sediment removal (dredging).  The USACE eHydro program provides a standardized archive of available hydrosurveys from across the country all in one place.   The USACE eHydro website includes the ability to search on a map to see where hydrosurveys are available, and when the most recent survey was conducted &#8211; an important detail since not all channels are surveyed with the same frequency.   Users can download the latest PDF Plotsheet for a channel, or download the underlying data for use in other geospatial software programs.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>by Jeanne Holm</p>
<p>In May 2009, Data.gov was an experiment. There were questions: would people use the data? would agencies share the data? and would it make a difference? We’ve all come a long way to answering those questions, starting with only 47 datasets and having <a href="http://catalog.data.gov">105,000 datasets</a> today. &nbsp;We realized that this was never simply about opening up government data, but rather about growing and nurturing an open data ecosystem to improve the lives of citizens.</p>
<h3><b>Putting the Data to Work</b></h3>
<p>Hundreds of <a href="http://www.data.gov/impact/">companies</a>, like those featured at the <a href="http://opendata500.com">Open Data 500</a>, are using data to create services and products. &nbsp;From agriculture to housing—businesses of all shapes and sizes are reliant on government data. During the last five years, there have been moments when someone was poised to use open data at a moment of crisis or opportunity. Some of these highlights include:<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/bsp-ocsit-prod-east-appdata/datagov/wordpress/2014/05/arc-hurricane.png">Arc hurricane</a></p>
<ul>
<li>The Red Cross, working with the Department of Transportation, released a <a href="http://www.redcross.org/mobile-apps/hurricane-app">Hurricane App</a> just as Hurricane Sandy touched ground—helping 700,000 people be safer that first day alone</li>
<li>Organizations have come to life around helping others and getting them data to inform their consumer decisions</li>
<li>A new level of digital democracy was reached when India and the United States, and later Canada and Ghana, created the Open Government Platform, a shared, open source system for open data portals</li>
<li><a href="http://catalog.data.gov/dataset?organization_type=City+Government&amp;_organization_type_limit=0">City</a>, <a href="http://catalog.data.gov/dataset?organization_type=County+Government&amp;_organization_type_limit=0">county</a>, and <a href="http://catalog.data.gov/dataset?organization_type=State+Government">state</a> data was integrated with federal data to make Data.gov a truly a national open data portal</li>
</ul>
<p>People today are using open data in even more creative ways. Civic hackers, designers, and developers, young and old, are being educated and connected through <a href="http://codeforamerica.org">Code for America</a>, <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">Code Academy</a>, and others that give them the tools to put the data to work and growing that ecosystem of developers and consumers of the data.</p>
<h3><b>Making More Data Available</b></h3>
<p>Much of the first year of Data.gov was spent on gathering the fuel for the ecosystem—open data. Open data teams at each agency and Data.gov worked together to change the culture from a “<i>how</i> will we release this data” to “what is the impact on Americans <i>when</i> we release this data.” With clear direction from the White House in the <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the_press_office/Transparency_and_Open_Government/">Presidential Transparency and Open Government</a> memo, the <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government.html">Digital Government</a> strategy, and the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/09/executive-order-making-open-and-machine-readable-new-default-government-">Executive Order for Open Data</a>, people at 175 agencies and <a href="http://catalog.data.gov/organization">77 other organizations</a> today continue to release more data, more accessible data, and new web services and APIs.2 In using <a href="http://twitter.com/usdatagov">social media</a>, sponsoring data jams and paloozas, creating and moderating the <a href="http://opendata.stackexchange.com/">Open Data Stack Exchange</a>, and transparently sharing code and issues on <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/bsp-ocsit-prod-east-appdata/datagov/wordpress/2014/09/Search_for_a_Dataset_-_Data.gov_-_2014-09-29_13.53.33.png">Github</a>, Data.gov and data publishers are listening to and working directly with researchers, innovators, data scientists, and data journalists to create a better platform with more data every day.</p>
<h3><b>Making a Difference</b></h3>
<p>So, has the release of government data helped to improve the lives of Americans? &nbsp;In just the last three years, Data.gov has grown to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>4.5 million unique visitors</li>
<li>105,000 data collections</li>
<li>447,000 data resources</li>
<li>227 organizations publishing data</li>
<li>4700 people attending the International Open Government Data Conference online and in person</li>
<li>21 topics</li>
<li>Citizens from 195 countries have visited the site</li>
</ul>
<p>Clearly, the answer is that people are working with open data, but there is still much more to do. Groups like the <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/">Sunlight Foundation</a> and data journalists help to advocate for the release of new data in machine-readable formats, and citizen groups create activities and initiatives around the data. As one example, behind the topics highlighted on Data.gov (such as <a href="http://climate.data.gov">climate</a>, <a href="http://health.data.gov">health</a>, <a href="http://safety.data.gov">safety</a>, and <a href="http://ocean.data.gov">ocean</a>), are communities of people from around the country and around the world who strive together to get specific data released to help solve humanity’s challenges. The community behind <a href="http://agriculture.data.gov">Agriculture.Data.gov</a> hosted an event last year that led to the formation of the Global Open Data for Agriculture and Nutrition (<a href="http://godan.info/">GODAN</a>) initiative that focuses on food security and mitigating hunger in developed and developing nations.</p>
<h2><b>What Is Your Story?</b></h2>
<p>You’ve heard here about some of the open data stories powered by data on Data.gov. &nbsp;<b>Now, we are issuing a call for YOUR story.</b> Tell the world what open data means to you. &nbsp;What have you built? How have you made a difference? What still needs to be accomplished? &nbsp;Answer the call for <em>Open Data Stories</em>: what we’ve accomplished, understood, and are still exploring after five years. Post a video, write a blog, or send a tweet (#OpenDataStory) and <a href="https://www.data.gov/contact">let us know</a>. &nbsp;We will connect the stories and highlight what you are doing. Be creative, be innovative, and let all of us celebrate your story.</p>
<p>Each person makes a difference—whether you are a researcher, developer, data scientist, business owner, innovator, data publisher, or citizen—each part of the ecosystem is important in our shared vision of making the world a better place through transparency, openness, and knowledge. Be part of the future and celebrate how far we’ve come—share your story, share your vision.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 2018 report from the U.S. Committee on the Marine Transportation System (CMTS) gathered recommendations and &#8216;lessons learned&#8217; from the 2017 hurricane season on how to improve resiliency across the marine transportation system.  The report notes that &#8220;over the course of the 2017 hurricane season, Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria affected the operating status of at least 45 ports throughout the lower continental United States and the U.S. Caribbean territories.  These ports provide critical services to regional economies in the Gulf of Mexico, Southeastern coast, and the Caribbean, and were confronted with a succession of major storms that impacts a massive geographical region with unique challenges&#8230; The scale and impact of these storms strained the U.S. emergency response community and the ability of MTS agencies to preposition and prioritize recovery efforts.&#8221;</p>
<p>This report relied on both expert comments and data gathered before, during, and after the hurricane season.  Estimates of the impacts discussed on this report utilized a variety of data sets across trade and transportation sectors.  These data sets including statistics on trade patterns and commodity tonnage from previous years; records of port advisory and closure status; historic vessel position reports; and storm-related characteristics such as date, location, and wind speed.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nautical charts provide critical information to mariners in support of safe navigation.  Historically these charts have been printed and distributed on paper, but modern communications systems allow for electronic charts that are able to be updated as new information becomes available.  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Office of Coast Survey produces charts for coastal and Great Lakes areas, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers produces charts for America&#8217;s inland rivers through the Inland Electronic Navigation Chart program.  The Inland Electronic Navigation Chart (IENC) program covers thousands of miles of navigable waterways.  America&#8217;s inland waterways move millions of tons of commodities every year, and the work of surveying, charting, and dredging sediment is continually ongoing due to the dynamic conditions and constant change happening along any given river.</p>
<p>Rivers included in the Inland Electronic Navigation Chart (IENC) program include the Allegheny River, Arkansas River, Atchafalaya River, Black Warrior-Tombigbee Rivers, Cumberland River, Green River, Illinois River, Kaskaskia, Kanawha River, Lower Mississippi River, Missouri River, Monongahela River, Ohio River, Ouachita River, Red River, Tennessee River (including the Tellico, Hiwassee, Clinch and Emory Rivers), Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway, Upper Mississippi River, and the White River.  Anyone can access the navigation charts for these rivers, which show depth contours, buoys, lights, known hazards, and reference landmarks.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#FFFFFF;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">The new catalog is the culmination of many months of work in updating the behind-the-scenes functioning of the Data.gov catalog, which automatically harvests over 1000 different sources from federal, state and local open data sources to provide a comprehensive catalog of open government data. The new catalog runs an updated version of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://ckan.org/" style="text-decoration:none;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#1155cc;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">CKAN</span></a><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#FFFFFF;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">, the open source technology behind the Data.gov catalog, and should improve the process of automatically updating Data.gov with the most recent datasets.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#FFFFFF;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">Most users will not notice any differences in the new catalog. At first, the front page of the catalog will show a small reduction in total datasets. That reflects the deletion of outdated datasets from harvest sources that are no longer maintained, mostly at the state and local level. As we have noted in the past, the front page number of total datasets changes frequently as many harvest sources are checked every day for updates. Also, the catalog counts collections of datasets as “1” in the total number. The validation and update of all 1,098 harvest sources should result in an improved user experience with a higher degree of accuracy and fewer broken links. In the coming months, we will deploy additional features to continue to improve the quality of the Data.gov catalog.</span></p>

<p>Due to demand, please access the data files here:<br />

<p>Today, the&nbsp;<a id="anch_17" class="ext" href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/12/07/hhs-publishes-covid-19-hospital-facility-level-data.html">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) published COVID-19 hospital data</a>&nbsp;at the facility level for each week, going back to August 1st 2020. This information was previously aggregated by state. This new data and its data quality are paramount to the U.S. pandemic response. COVID-19 models, analyses, and predictive analytics can only be as good as the data they ingest. By sharing these new hospital COVID-19 capacity data at the&nbsp;<a id="anch_18" href="https://healthdata.gov/dataset/covid-19-reported-patient-impact-and-hospital-capacity-facility">facility-level</a>&nbsp;with the public, the opportunity exists to improve data quality.</p>
<p>This data is tremendously complex and is the result of substantial ongoing efforts by hospital, state, and Federal personnel who collaborate to meet daily data reporting requirements. This ongoing collaboration has&nbsp;<a id="anch_19" href="https://healthdata.gov/covid-19-hospital-reporting-hospital-reporting-trend-dashboard">steadily improved data quality and reporting consistency</a>&nbsp;in recent weeks, even as the content of hospital capacity data has become more complex.</p>
<p>We opted not to have perfect be the enemy of good, so these datasets will have imperfections. To continue improving the quality of data, we welcome your feedback. When more people access and use the data, we have more collective ability to identify gaps, errors, or other problems with these COVID-19 datasets. All stakeholders — local community coordinators, data scientists, data journalists, and healthcare researchers — are encouraged to download, analyze, study the datasets, and&nbsp;<a id="anch_20" class="mailto" href="mailto:HealthData@hhs.gov?subject=COVID-19%20Open%20Data%20-%20feedback">share your feedback</a>&nbsp;with HealthData.gov.</p>
<p>We also encourage you to visit and contribute to&nbsp;<a id="anch_21" class="ext" href="https://github.com/CareSet/COVID_Hospital_PUF">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</a>&nbsp;about this hospital-level data. These living FAQs are crowdsourced from the public, so your contributions will improve these FAQs over time.</p>
<p><strong>Commitment to Transparency and Open Data</strong></p>
<p>By opening COVID-19 datasets, our collective goal is to accelerate scientific and public health insights and shorten the time it takes for COVID-19 information and solutions to save lives. Our HHS efforts are enabling a data-driven ecosystem for everyone. Based on public feedback and interaction with the COVID-19 datasets, this open-data ecosystem will evolve while guided by these principles: Transparency. Sharing. Privacy. Security. Community.</p>
<p>Today’s unprecedented pandemic demands near-real-time data sharing across government, across diverse sectors, and with the public. HHS is aggressively responding to this call-to-action by responsibly unlocking information wherever our societal benefits of data access outweigh the potential risks. This is a collaborative effort led by HHS Office of the Chief Data Officer, within the Office of the Chief Information Officer, in close coordination with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), local/state/tribal governments, HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH), HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), and the White House U.S. Digital Service.</p>
<p>Beyond the whole-of-government response, COVID-19 necessitates a whole-of-America response. Your public input so far has enabled HHS to identify and prioritize information of highest value. We appreciate the hard-working journalists, data scientists, academic healthcare researchers, business innovators, and Americans who are giving time, energy, and insights to help us responsibly open data related to the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>The data reporting is one part of the whole-of-government response and is to ensure that every patient requiring hospitalization receives the care they need. Patients should not be discouraged from seeking hospital care based on their interpretation of the data. Hospitals have protocols in place to keep patients safe from exposure and to ensure all patients are prioritized for care. By working together across sectors, we are harnessing all capabilities and resources to unleash the power of U.S. data for the COVID-19 response.</p>
<p>Together, we can combat COVID-19.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) interactive energy disruption maps combine real-time data feeds from&nbsp;NOAA&#8217;s National Hurricane Center&nbsp;with more than 20 map layers showing the nation&#8217;s energy infrastructure and resources. This new tool, available around the clock on the EIA website, allows industry, energy analysts, government decision makers, and the American public to better see and understand the potential impact of a storm. Although not strictly a climate analysis tool, such capabilities can be coupled with climate projection tools to explore future scenarios of risks and vulnerabilities.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today marks the launch of the </span><a href="https://catalog.data.gov/group/older-adults-health-data"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Older Adults Health Data Collection</span></em></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – a new resource cataloging over 200 Federal datasets previously available on Data.gov related to the health of older Americans. This centralized location will assist experts from academia, industry, government, civil society, and the public in accessing datasets from various Federal agencies and across a range of health-related issues (e.g. health status, health risks and behaviors, and health care) to advance our collective knowledge and understanding of the health of older adults.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analyzing data on the older adult population in the time periods before, during, and after the pandemic is an important step to gaining a better understanding of both the health of this age group as well the immediate and long-term impacts of the pandemic. The </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Older Adults Health Data Collection</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> contains datasets that capture outcomes directly related to COVID-19 as well as others that do not, and the number of COVID-19 related datasets in the collection is anticipated to grow over time. Datasets without COVID-19-specific data elements still provide important context on the health of older adults before the pandemic and are likely to incorporate COVID-19 data elements in their data collection procedures in the months and years to come.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demographic trends underscore just how vital it will be to understand this growing population group. By 2030, one in five Americans will be 65 years and older. Over the next 40 years, the number of Americans 65 years and older will almost double.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><sup>1</sup></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> COVID-19 has also significantly impacted this age group, as underscored by evidence that older adults have experienced the highest hospitalization and morbidity rates from the pandemic.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><sup>2</sup></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This is partly the result of older adults having high rates of chronic diseases, such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, arthritis, and cancer, which are the Nation’s leading drivers of illness, disability, deaths, and health care costs.&nbsp;</span></p>

</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This new resource aligns with the intent of the </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/M-19-23.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and directives in the </span><a href="https://strategy.data.gov/action-plan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal Data Strategy 2020 Action Plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> both of which encourage increased public access to Government data, collaboration with non-Government entities, interagency collaboration, and protection of data security and confidentiality.&nbsp; This data collection also supports the efforts of the </span><a href="https://www.agingstats.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal Interagency Forum on Aging Related Statistics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which aims to improve the quality and utility of data on the aging population.&nbsp; Two of the Aging Forum’s goals include encouraging cross-national research on the aging population and promoting communication among data producers, researchers, and public policymakers. Additional non-health and non-Federal datasets related to older adults are available at </span><a href="https://www.agingstats.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">agingstats.gov</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the first national open data site, Data.gov is the ideal platform to provide a wide variety of stakeholders with access to the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Older Adults Health Data Collection</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Data in this collection has been made available in open formats while ensuring privacy and security, consistent with all applicable laws, regulations, and policies governing data use, disclosure, and sharing. By reducing the time spent searching for data on the health of older adults from hours to seconds, the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Older Adults Health Data Collection</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> serves as a helpful resource to put Federal data to work on behalf of Americans.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Data.gov has made a few updates to its home page in recent days.<br />
For users seeking information about the coronavirus, we have added a prominent link to <a href="https://www.coronavirus.gov/">coronavirus.gov</a></p>
<p>We have also added navigation to two existing sites, <a href="https://strategy.data.gov/">strategy.data.gov</a> and <a href="https://resources.data.gov/">resources.data.gov</a>.  Strategy.data.gov is the home of the Federal Data Strategy, with information about the strategy, the Action Plan, and <a href="https://strategy.data.gov/progress">progress</a> toward the Action Plan items, as determined by the Office of Management and Budget. Resources.data.gov is an online repository of tools, best practices, and schema standards to facilitate adoption of open data practices. The site is a joint effort of OMB, the Office of Government Information Services of the National Archives, and GSA, as required by the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/115/plaws/publ435/PLAW-115publ435.pdf">OPEN Government Data Act.</a></p>
<p>In addition, we have conducted a content review of the site to archive outdated content. Datasets are not affected, as the Data.gov <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset">catalog</a> is continually updated automatically by harvesting metadata maintained by the contributing agencies. Under the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/115/plaws/publ435/PLAW-115publ435.pdf">OPEN Government Data Act</a>, federal agencies maintain comprehensive inventories of their data assets that are harvested into the federal data catalog, Data.gov. Progress on agency data inventories can be tracked on this <a href="https://labs.data.gov/dashboard/offices/qa">dashboard.</a> Overall progress on the Federal Data Strategy is reported on <a href="https://strategy.data.gov/">strategy.data.gov.</a></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) has redesigned its International Energy Portal to streamline navigation, simplify data presentation, and implement responsive design use. EIA based many of the redesigned aspects on customer feedback about the earlier beta release of the portal.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eia.gov/international/overview/world">International Energy Portal</a> contains EIA’s country-level energy data. Users can view and download datasets for consumption, production, trade, reserves, and carbon dioxide emissions for different fuels and energy sources. The portal also provides access to EIA&#8217;s entire library of international reports, articles, and analyses, including <i>Country Analysis Briefs</i>.</p>
<p><b>Find data in fewer steps.</b></p>
<p>Users can select and explore prepopulated, fuel-specific default tables that provide annual data on energy production, consumption, trade, and reserves. Data options allow users to change time frequency and energy units, add sources and activities, and select other countries for comparison.</p>
<p><b>Customize data tables.</b></p>
<p>Customizable data tables allow users to sort by energy source and activity or by country and region. Users can now see and select countries within continental regions, International Energy Agency regions, and economic groups.</p>
<p><b>Tailor visualizations to user needs.</b></p>
<p>Animated maps allow users to see how trends in energy production, consumption, reserves, imports, and exports have changed over time. Other visualization options include heat maps, bubble maps, and time series.</p>
<p><b>Export data easily.</b></p>
<p>EIA’s international information is easily downloaded as data, maps, and charts for presentations, reports, and spreadsheets. Data downloads are available in CSV and JSON formats. Application Programming Interface (API) keys are available with EIA’s Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets add-ins, which make regular data updates much easier. Users can also download static versions of charts and tables in PDF or PNG image files.</p>

EIA recently launched its new&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.eia.gov/beta/electricity/gridmonitor/?src=email" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.eia.gov/beta/electricity/gridmonitor/?src%3Demail&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1574267669577000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF7QGBiA4TgNj1KToFU5C0xvK0nGA">Hourly Electric Grid Monitor</a></em>, a redesigned and enhanced version of EIA’s existing&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.eia.gov/realtime_grid/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.eia.gov/realtime_grid/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1574267669577000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHjA-Druh41rXereQkTEC7DTixlYw">U.S. Electric System Operating Data</a></em>&nbsp;website.&nbsp; The data for the&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.eia.gov/beta/electricity/gridmonitor/?src=email" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.eia.gov/beta/electricity/gridmonitor/?src%3Demail&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1574267669577000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF7QGBiA4TgNj1KToFU5C0xvK0nGA">Hourly Electric Grid Monitor</a></em>&nbsp;come from the Form EIA-930,&nbsp;<em>Hourly and Daily Balancing Authority Operations Report</em>, which collects hourly electricity demand, forecast demand, net generation, and interchange data from the 65 electricity balancing authorities that operate the electric grid in the Lower 48 states.&nbsp; The&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.eia.gov/beta/electricity/gridmonitor/?src=email" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.eia.gov/beta/electricity/gridmonitor/?src%3Demail&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1574267669577000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF7QGBiA4TgNj1KToFU5C0xvK0nGA">Hourly Electric Grid Monitor</a></em>&nbsp;incorporates two new data elements: hourly electricity generation by energy source and hourly subregional demand. The new website also provides new and more flexible options for visualizing the data and allows users to create custom dashboards that can be saved and shared.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Although electric system balancing authorities covering most of the United States have released real-time information on grid operations since the late 1990s, EIA’s Hourly Electric Grid Monitor expands the availability of data to the entire contiguous 48 states, and makes it available in a consistent format from a single source.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Among other applications, the data can be used to provide timely information on electric system recovery after power interruptions and to help evaluate the effects of renewable energy, smart grid, and demand-response programs on power system operations. &nbsp;The tool allows you to visualize and analyze:</p>
<ul style="font-weight: 400;">
<li>Total U.S. and regional electricity demand on an hourly basis</li>
<li>The varied mix of energy sources used to generate electricity at different times and locations</li>
<li>The hourly flow of electricity between electric systems</li>
<li>The wide variety in electric systems’ daily demand shapes and the seasonality of daily demand patterns</li>
<li>The extent to which electric systems rely on internal and external sources of supply to meet their demand</li>
<li>Potential stress on electric systems when actual demand significantly exceeds forecasted demand</li>
<li>Total hourly flows of electricity with Canada and Mexico</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Have fun exploring!</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) is responsible for investigating reportable marine casualties, accidents, and serious marine incidents.  The relevant mission statement and specific regulations can be found on the <a href="https://homeport.uscg.mil/Lists/Content/DispForm.aspx?ID=2602">USCG Investigations Division homepage</a>.  After an incident has been reported, it is entered into a national database of all marine casualty and pollution incidents.  These important <a href="https://homeport.uscg.mil/missions/investigations/marine-casualty-pollution-investigations">historical records can then be accessed </a>by researchers interested in understanding maritime safety, accident prevention, or trends in certain types of maritime incidents through time.  Other agencies interested in maritime transportation performance measures rely on the USCG data to <a href="http://navigation.usace.army.mil/MTS/Performance/Safety">examine incident trends </a>on U.S. waterways.  Files for the <a href="https://homeport.uscg.mil/Lists/Content/DispForm.aspx?&amp;ID=211&amp;Source=https://homeport.uscg.mil/missions/investigations/marine-casualty-pollution-investigations">Marine Casualty and Pollution Data for Researchers datasets </a>can be downloaded directly from the U.S. Coast Guard Homeport website by following the drop-down menu options on the homepage <strong>Missions</strong>: <strong>Investigations</strong>: <a href="https://homeport.uscg.mil/missions/investigations/marine-casualty-pollution-investigations">Marine Casualty Pollution Investigations </a>page at https://homeport.uscg.mil/missions/investigations/marine-casualty-pollution-investigations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As described by the USCG, &#8220;the Marine Casualty and Pollution Data files provide details about marine casualty and pollution incidents investigated by Coast Guard Offices throughout the United States. The database can be used to analyze marine accidents and pollution incidents by a variety of factors including vessel or facility type, injuries, fatalities, pollutant details, location, and date.  The data collection period began in 1982 for marine casualties and 1973 for polluting incidents, and is ongoing. Documentation includes entity and attribute descriptions along with suggested solutions to general marine pollution, vessel casualty, and personnel injury and death questions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Visitors to the USCG Homeport data download site should note that there are three files available fore download, but it is the second file on the list (named MISLE_DATA.zip) that contains all available marine casualty data from January 2002 &#8211; July 2015.  The files extracted from MISLE_DATA.zip can be opened with most standard spreadsheet editing software programs.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.navcen.uscg.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">U.S. Coast Guard</a> maintains an archive of historical vessel position movements, collected through the Nationwide Automatic Identification System (NAIS).  Originally designed to improve maritime safety and security, these historical vessel position records have proven to be a valuable resource for a variety of engineers and researchers studying the aquatic world.  For example, fishery resource managers with the responsibility of improving multiple sturgeon populations have used historical data from the NAIS to evaluate where fish and vessels might interact.  Before sturgeon populations crashed in the late 1800s, harvests along the Atlantic coast were measured in thousands of tons.  If sturgeon populations rebound to their historical levels it could mean the renaissance of a commercial and recreational fishery that has been lost for generations.  Understanding where sturgeon might be at risk from vessel strikes or propeller cuts is just one small part of a larger conservation and recovery effort around the country.  The public can request historical vessel position data through the U.S. Coast Guard Navigation Center (NAVCEN) online portal.  To learn more about sturgeon and efforts to rebuild fish stocks visit the <a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/atlantic-sturgeon" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NOAA Fisheries website</a>.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This May marks the tenth anniversary of Data.gov, the federal government’s open data site. Launched by the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) in May 2009 with a modest 47 datasets, Data.gov has grown to over 200,000 datasets from hundreds of data sources including federal agencies, states, counties, and cities. Data.gov set the example for other open government data catalogs, with hundreds of other countries, states, and cities around the world launching their own open government data sites since 2009.</p>
<p>Data.gov provides easy access to government datasets covering a wide range of topics—everything from weather, demographics, health, education, housing, and agriculture. The data is used by the public, students, researchers, journalists, and businesses. Usage of Data.gov has grown steadily over the years, reaching approximately 20 million page views annually.</p>
<p>Data.gov’s tenth anniversary coincides with a major change in the program. On January 14, 2019, the OPEN Government Data Act, as part of the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/4174/text#toc-H8E449FBAEFA34E45A6F1F20EFB13ED95">Foundations for Evidence Based Policymaking Act</a>, became law. The OPEN Government Data Act makes Data.gov a requirement in statute, rather than a policy. It requires federal agencies to publish their information online as open data, using standardized, machine-readable data formats, with their metadata included in the Data.gov <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset">catalog</a>. Data.gov is working with an expanded group of federal agencies to include their datasets in Data.gov as they implement the new law. In addition, the law requires that GSA work with the Office of Management and Budget and the <a href="https://www.archives.gov/ogis">Office of Government Information Services</a> to establish an “online repository of tools, best practices, and schema standards to facilitate the adoption of open data practices across the Federal Government.” This new repository, which will be an update and expansion of <a href="https://project-open-data.cio.gov/">Project Open Data</a>, will also be available on Data.gov.</p>
<p>Data.gov marks its tenth anniversary with a strong foundation in a new statutory requirement and expectations for an expanded scope with data from additional federal agencies and for sharing updated tools and resources in a new online repository. Opening more data will continue to ensure that the best sources of information are accessible to the public and support the goals of an open and transparent government.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the last few days, you may have noticed a significant drop in the total number of datasets displayed on the Data.gov <a href="https://catalog.data.gov">catalog</a>. The decrease was not due to an actual reduction in the number of datasets, but the removal of duplicate entries for many datasets. This was not as a result of duplicates in the sources of the metadata in the Data.gov catalog (agency metadata harvest sources), but due to a problem with the Data.gov harvester. The duplicate entries were removed during the weekend of February 23-24 and archives of the duplicates have been retained to allow agencies to fully review these changes. </p>
<p>Harvesting for most federal agency dataset sources occurs on a daily, automated basis. As agencies update their metadata inventories, the Data.gov catalog is updated at the next scheduled harvest. As a result, the total number of datasets on the Data.gov <a href="https://catalog.data.gov">catalog</a> normally fluctuates. In the coming weeks and months, we expect to see an increase in datasets provided by a greater number of federal agencies under the recently enacted Open Government Data Act (Title II of the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/4174/text">Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act</a>, Pub. L. 114-435). We will provide updates on our progress in working with the federal agencies in providing access to more federal data under the statute.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.opc.ca.gov/category/programs-seafloor-and-coastal-mapping/">California Seafloor and Coastal Mapping Program</a> has brought together federal, state, and local stakeholders to develop and share an extensive variety of seafloor-mapping datasets. This collaborative effort that brought together bathymetric (seafloor), geologic, and biological data relevant to California’s State Waters was recently described in a scientific article by <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0964569117301242">Johnson et al. (2017)</a> in the journal Ocean &amp; Coastal Management.   But there is more to the story than just mapping, the spatial information captured through this multi-year effort will help update nautical charts relevant to the marine transportation system, improve earthquake and tsunami hazard assessments, improve understanding of erosion and shoreline change processes, and be used to make decisions that support healthy marine ecosystems and fisheries.  One map can serve many purposes, for example, geological maps made from seismic-reflection data of the seafloor can identify fault lines that are used in forecasting earthquake impacts, but also show where san deposits exist that can be used for beach nourishment (Johnston et al. (2017)).  Geological mapping is also used to understand the risk of saltwater intrusion into freshwater aquifers that sit in coastal areas, a problem that exists in multiple parts of the U.S. <a href="https://walrus.wr.usgs.gov/mapping/csmp/map_production.html"> Maps from this effort are available for download </a>at no cost through the <a href="https://walrus.wr.usgs.gov/mapping/csmp/map_production.html">U.S. Geological Survey website</a>. Users who want to create their own maps can explore bathymetric and coastal zone data for California on Data.Gov, including the example datasets listed below.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The North Atlantic ocean is a busy place, full of sea life, ships, and &#8211; fortunately &#8211; a slew of data.  Anyone interested in local, state, or regional marine planning efforts in New England can visit the <a href="http://www.northeastoceandata.org/">Northeast Ocean Data portal </a>(http://www.northeastoceandata.org/), which provides ocean-related maps and data to the public.  The <a href="http://www.northeastoceandata.org/">Northeast Ocean Data portal </a>directly supports the <a href="http://neoceanplanning.org/about/">Northeast Regional Planning Body</a>, which is responsible for developing the ocean plan for New England with representation from states, federally recognized tribes, federal agencies, and the New England Fishery Management Council.  The Northeast Ocean Data portal relies on open data from multiple federal and state partners to provide comprehensive information about ocean conditions and ocean uses.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.northeastoceandata.org/data/">data available for download </a>through the Northeast Ocean Data portal ranges from physical oceanographic characteristics (like shoreline classification and seafloor depth measurements) to administrative boundaries, to animal habitats and species abundance, to data on overlapping ocean uses among diverse user groups such as aquaculture, marine transportation, recreational boating/fishing, and energy production and transmission.  Multiple relevant <a href="http://www.northeastoceandata.org/data/external-data-sources/">external data sources </a>such an real-time weather forecasts can also be accessed through the portal.  Users can also <a href="http://www.northeastoceandata.org/maps/">view, edit, and download maps</a> on topics such as water quality, commercial fishing, energy and infrastructure, and the presence of animal groups like fish, birds, or marine mammals.  Two example maps are shown below, one displays navigation-related features and the other features marine mammal abundance.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/09/12/under-hood-building-new-college-scorecard-students" target="_blank">students are able to compare the cost of college</a> with other significant data points, such as graduation rates and average salaries of graduates to determine where to get the most bang for their buck. Communities can finally map demographic, income, and school data to promote <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/07/11/weekly-address-making-our-communities-stronger-through-fair-housing" target="_blank">Fair Housing</a>. Patients can find information on the safety and cost of hospitals, nursing homes, and physicians, empowering them to make <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/facts-and-features/fact-sheets/better-care-smarter-spending-healthier-people.html" target="_blank">smarter health care choices</a>. These diverse tools benefit different groups of people, industries, and communities, yet all rely on one thing: open data.</p>
<p>Open data from the U.S. Government is an important national resource, serving as fuel for innovation and scientific discovery. It is central to a more efficient, transparent, and collaborative democracy. Since President Obama’s first day in office, his commitment to ensuring all Americans reap the benefits of public open data has been unwavering. Throughout the Administration, the U.S. Government has implemented policies to open its data, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/transparency-and-open-government" target="_blank">Presidential Memorandum on “Transparency and Open Government”</a></li>
<li><a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/memoranda_2010/m10-06.pdf" target="_blank">Open Government Directive</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/09/executive-order-making-open-and-machine-readable-new-default-government-" target="_blank">Executive Order 13642 “Making Open and Machine Readable the New Default for Government Information”</a></li>
<li><a href="https://project-open-data.cio.gov/policy-memo" target="_blank">OMB Memorandum M-13-13: “Open Data Policy—Managing Information as an Asset.”</a></li>
</ul>
<p>2015 was a year of great advancement in open data initiatives. Progress on <a href="https://project-open-data.cio.gov/" target="_blank">Project Open Data</a> has been growing each year, and is expected to continue as the Administration continues to prioritize open data because of the value returned to society. Federal agencies continue to release and improve their open data for more citizens, non-profits, and companies. You can see how agencies are doing over time, with quarterly evaluations by agency on the <a href="http://labs.data.gov/dashboard/offices" target="_blank">Project Open Data Dashboard</a>.</p>
<p>As we look towards the work to be done in 2016, we also celebrate open data milestones and successes over the past year:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chief Data Roles. </strong>Central to a data-driven government is committed leadership dedicated to data improvements and comprehensive information management. In 2015 the White House welcomed the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/05/06/email-dj-patil-how-i-became-chief-data-scientist" target="_blank">first-ever U.S. Chief Data Scientist</a> and Deputy Chief Technology Officer for Data Policy, DJ Patil. In 2015, several Federal Agencies, including the Department of Commerce, the Environmental Protection Agency, and General Services Administration, followed suit, adding Chief Data Officers and Chief Data Scientists to their rosters.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Open Data Making a Difference</strong>. Open data was a key ingredient to addressing pressing policy issues in 2015, including: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tpaj9Sm7i7I&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m46s" target="_blank">helping students and families better evaluate college choices</a> with a new <a href="https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/" target="_blank">College Scorecard</a>; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lSLIhXrs1Y&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2m17s" target="_blank">making it easier for communities to implement the Fair Housing Act</a> with the <a href="http://www.huduser.gov/portal/affht_pt.html#affhassess-tab" target="_blank">Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing Assessment Tool</a>; and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ed-_KJ4fE0g&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m22s" target="_blank">enhancing trust between communities and law enforcement</a> with the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/10/27/police-data-initiative-5-month-update" target="_blank">White House Police Data Initiative</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Open Data Updates and Improvements</strong>. 2015 also saw many expansions on pivotal open governmental datasets, such as: new <strong>U.S. Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative </strong><a href="https://useiti.doi.gov/explore/federal-production/" target="_blank"><strong>federal production</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a href="https://useiti.doi.gov/explore/federal-revenue-by-company/" target="_blank"><strong>federal revenue by company</strong></a><strong> data</strong>; new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau <strong>Consumer Complaint Database tools (</strong><a href="https://api.open.fec.gov/developers/"><strong>API</strong></a><strong>)</strong>; and various <a href="https://open.fda.gov/" target="_blank">OpenFDA updates</a><strong>,</strong> including <a href="https://open.fda.gov/update/openfda-now-allows-direct-downloads-of-data/" target="_blank">direct downloads</a> that enable citizens to use data on food, drug, and medical device safety. The Federal Government also provided new platforms for exploring government data, including: <a href="https://open.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">Open.nasa.gov</a>, <a href="http://www.patentsview.org/web/" target="_blank">USPTO’s PatentsView</a>, and <a href="http://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/?p=10221" target="_blank">Landsat on AWS</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Website Dashboards. </strong>Last year two new dashboards were also created to better evaluate the health of our Federal government websites: <a href="https://analytics.usa.gov/" target="_blank">Analytics.usa.gov</a> tracks how people are interacting with the government online and <a href="https://pulse.cio.gov/" target="_blank">Pulse.cio.gov</a> helps the government and public observe progress on HTTPS and Web Analytics.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public Engagement around Open Data</strong>. Federal agencies featured open data efforts at dozens of hackathons, data jams, and conferences including the <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/blog/2015/05/29/health-datapalooza-how-open-data-improving-your-health-care.html" target="_blank">2015 Health Datapalooza</a>,<a href="http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/2015datapalooza/" target="_blank">Transportation Datapalooza</a>, <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/about-us/organizational-offices/office-under-secretary-and-director/third-annual-safety-datapalooza" target="_blank">Third Annual Safety Datapalooza</a>, <a href="http://www.innovation.va.gov/suicideprevention/" target="_blank">Mental Health Hackathons</a>, an Accessibility Hackathon, a White House Mapathon, and eight Open Data Roundtables.</li>
</ul>
<p>One common denominator of these successes is that open data is a collaborative process, involving Federal government, state and local governments, academia, private sectors, and civil society. It takes a village to transform open data into actionable knowledge and societal value. Like data science, open data is a team sport, united by the shared purpose to responsibly unleash the power of data for the benefit of the American public and maximize the nation&#8217;s return on its investment in data. Together in 2016 and beyond, &#8220;Team Open Data&#8221; will continue transforming open data into knowledge, into action.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Data.gov is launching two innovations today to mark both the anniversary of the Digital Government Strategy and the fourth anniversary of Data.gov. First is a comprehensive listing of the <a href="http://www.data.gov/developers/page/developer-resources">application programming interfaces</a> (APIs) that were released from across the federal government as part of the Digital Government Strategy. These APIs will fuel the development of new apps on everything from health, public safety, education, consumer protection, and many more topics of interest to Americans. Developers can find all the government’s APIs in one place, with links to API documentation and other resources.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/bsp-ocsit-prod-east-appdata/datagov/wordpress/2013/10/geo3.jpg" alt="" width="702" height="536"/></p>
<p>Data.gov is also launching a new&nbsp;<a href="http://catalog.data.gov/">data catalog</a>&nbsp;on an open source data management system called&nbsp;<a href="http://ckan.org/">CKAN</a>&nbsp; The new catalog features a number of enhancements, such as an improved search that helps you find all the datasets for a particular location, better sorting and tagging of datasets, and more robust metadata. Data.gov now has one unified data catalog based on an open source standard that will make it easier to federate with other federal agency catalogs, as well as those of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.data.gov/states/community/states">states</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.data.gov/cities/community/cities">cities</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.data.gov/counties/community/counties">counties</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new CKAN catalog will also enable the central implementation of the&nbsp;Open Data Policy, as it will easily harvest the data inventories that federal agencies will be creating under the policy. The result will be an easy-to-use, comprehensive catalog that will allow citizens, developers and others to fully take advantage of the vast array of federal data that affects the daily lives of citizens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also released new tools on Project Open Data that will help agencies easily meet the requirement of the policy, while laying the foundation for the new Data.gov infrastructure across government.</p>
<p>Today is just the first step in a number of dramatic improvements in Data.gov scheduled for the months ahead. If you are a developer and want to follow along on the progress, check out the <a href="https://github.com/project-open-data">Project Open Data repository</a> on GitHub. Be sure to check out the government-wide&nbsp;<a href="http://www.data.gov/developers/page/developer-resources">APIs</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://catalog.data.gov/">new catalog</a>&nbsp;and stay tuned!&nbsp;</p>

<p><!--break--></p>
<p>The US Department of Veterans Affairs originally launched&nbsp;<a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2010/10/07/blue-button-provides-access-downloadable-personal-health-data">Blue Button</a>&nbsp;with industry and non-profit collaboration.&nbsp; It’s a simple, common-sense idea—people should be able to access and download their own health information—with the potential for a big impact.</p>
<p>As President Obama&nbsp;<a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-disabled-veterans-america-conference-atlanta-georgia">said</a>&nbsp;in August 2010, “For the first time ever, veterans will be able to go to the VA website, click a simple blue button, and download or print your personal health records so you have them and can share with your doctor outside of the VA.”</p>
<p>Why can’t the same common-sense concept be applied to the energy industry with a “Green Button”?&nbsp; Consumers should have access to their energy usage information.&nbsp; It should be easily downloadable and in an easy-to-read format offered by their utility or retail energy service provider.</p>
<p>So today at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gridweek.com/2011/">GridWeek</a>, I&nbsp;<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bsp-ocsit-prod-east-appdata/datagov/wordpress/2013/10/microsites/ostp/smartgrid09-15-11.pdf">challenged</a>&nbsp;the smart grid ecosystem to deliver on the vision of Green Button and provide customers access to their energy usage information electronically.&nbsp; With this information at their fingertips, consumers would be enabled to make more informed decisions about their energy use and, when coupled with opportunities to take action, empowered to actively manage their energy use.</p>
<p>Furthermore, making this information available—in simple standard formats—will help spur innovative new consumer applications and devices from entrepreneurs, big companies, and even&nbsp;<a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2011/04/27/drawing-inspiration-smart-grid-innovation-america-s-youth">students</a>.&nbsp; Imagine being able to check your air conditioner from your smartphone or having a clothes dryer that saves money for you automatically during&nbsp;<a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2011/07/22/state-and-federal-grid-gurus-working-together-beat-heat">critically hot days</a>&nbsp;or simply getting some helpful customized hints on how best to save energy and money in your house or apartment.</p>
<p>This concept of encouraging customer access to electronic energy usage information is part of the Administration’s&nbsp;<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bsp-ocsit-prod-east-appdata/datagov/wordpress/2013/10/microsites/ostp/nstc-smart-grid-june2011.pdf">Policy Framework for a 21st Century Grid</a>. This framework,&nbsp;<a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2011/06/15/white-house-event-amps-grid-modernization-efforts">launched</a>&nbsp;at a&nbsp;<a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/photos-and-video/video/2011/06/13/building-21st-century-grid">White House event</a>&nbsp;in June 2011, highlights the value of empowering consumers with enhanced information to save energy, ensure privacy, and shrink bills.</p>
<p>The vision of consumer access to energy data is shared by the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (<a href="http://www.naruc.org/">NARUC</a>), which recently passed a&nbsp;<a href="http://summer.narucmeetings.org/2011SummerFinalResolutions.pdf">resolution</a>&nbsp;endorsing smart grid principles that include the importance of providing consumers with affordable and timely access to their own energy use data.</p>
<p>And if modeled after a successful program like Blue Button, Green Button has the potential to deliver untold benefits to consumers and utilities alike.</p>
<p>Since its release, Blue Button has been adopted by Medicare, the Department of Defense, and private sector health care organizations.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.health2challenge.org/2010/08/10/blue-button-challenge/">Software developer challenges</a>&nbsp;have spurred applications that expand on the Blue Button’s promise by helping consumers use their data to stay healthy and manage their care.</p>
<p>Through a collaborative effort, we can build an open-reference implementation of a Green Button, based on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nist.gov/smartgrid/priority-actions.cfm">national standards for the smart grid</a>.&nbsp; If the health industry can work together through Blue Button to make this world a better place, then the energy industry can do so through Green Button.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s get to work.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The heart of Data.gov is the <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset">catalog</a>. The Data.gov catalog brings together datasets from hundreds of agency sources across the federal government and from 50 non-federal sources. Metadata for datasets that are available to the public are maintained by the agencies that contribute to Data.gov. The Data.gov catalog harvests these agency metadata sources to present a unified, constantly updated catalog. </p>
<p>The total number of datasets on the front page of the <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset">catalog</a> changes regularly as datasets are added or deleted at the agency metadata source. The total number includes many <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?q=collection_metadata%3Atrue">collections</a>, such as a time series dataset that has periodic datasets across a number of years. A collection that includes thousands of datasets will only count as “1” dataset in the overall total.</p>
<p>You may have noticed significant changes recently in the total number of datasets on the Data.gov catalog front page. This fluctuation is due to a technical problem associated with the harvesting process that is creating duplicate datasets. The Data.gov team is working on carefully deleting the duplicates and restoring full functionality of the harvester. Currently, we are updating the catalog by initiating harvests of individual agency sources on a case by case basis as we work on restoring automatic daily harvesting for all sources.</p>
<p>We are also working on plans to upgrade the software that powers the Data.gov catalog, which is currently based on an older version of <a href="https://ckan.org/">CKAN</a>, the open source platform used by many national data catalogs. We will continue to provide updates on the status of the harvester and our migration of the catalog to the current version of CKAN. If you have any questions, please feel free to <a href="https://www.data.gov/contact">contact us</a>.</p>

<p>In less than a week since Popular Choice voting began in our Apps for the Environment challenge, you already <a href="http://appsfortheenvironment.challenge.gov/submissions">placed more than 1200 votes</a> in support of your favorite green apps. We&rsquo;re excited by the response from the community, but not surprised after people from around the country already submitted <a href="https://developer.epa.gov/forums/forum/applications/new-application-ideas/">almost 100 ideas for apps</a> and created <a href="http://appsfortheenvironment.challenge.gov/submissions">38 final products that both use EPA data and promote public health</a>. By listening to and working with the community from the beginning, together we&rsquo;ve gained the momentum in helping developers and entrepreneurs use our environmental data to create innovative services that can make an impact.</p>
<p><!--break--></p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t get here overnight, however, the contributions and leadership of people from coast to coast brought the Apps for the Environment mission into our local communities. The <a href="http://cleanwebhack.com/hackathon/">CleanWeb Hackathon</a> recently held in San Francisco brought together a diverse array of engineers, data providers, start-ups, designers, and investors to see what kind of useful apps could be created around energy and environment data over the course of a weekend. One-hundred and seventy-five people signed up for 100 spots, including a specialist from our own EPA Region 9 office, to innovate across 60 different <a href="http://cleanwebhack.com/hackathon/datasets/">data sets</a>.</p>
<p>Despite it being a separate event from Apps for the Environment, multiple developers who participated also submitted to our challenge. This was a big step toward building a sustainable relationship between EPA, the Department of Energy, and developers.</p>
<p>Thank you all for your continued participation, and remember, you can still vote for Popular Choice App for the Environment until Oct. 7 &ndash; make your voice heard, join our community as a supporter, and let us know how we can work together better as we bring innovation from your ideas to the palms of hands.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/05/18/fact-sheet-creating-opportunity-all-through-stronger-safer-communities">the President is in Camden</a> to talk about the promising progress that city is making in enhancing community policing. Last December, President Obama launched the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/04/09/using-technology-and-data-improve-community-policing-police-data-initiative">Task Force on 21st Century Policing</a> to better understand specific policing challenges and help communities identify actions they can take to improve law enforcement and enhance community engagement. Since that time, we have seen law enforcement agencies around the country working harder than ever to make the promise of community policing real.</p>
<p>Many of the Task Force’s recommendations emphasize the opportunity for departments to better use data and technology to build community trust. As a response, the White House has launched the Police Data Initiative, which has mobilized 21 leading jurisdictions across the country to take fast action on concrete deliverables responding to these Task Force recommendations in the area of data and technology. Camden is one such jurisdiction.</p>
<p>By finding innovative work already underway in these diverse communities and bringing their leaders together with top technologists, researchers, data scientists and design experts, the Police Data Initiative is helping accelerate progress around data transparency and analysis, toward the goal of increased trust and impact. Through the Initiative, key stakeholders are establishing a community of practice that will allow for knowledge sharing, community-sourced problem solving, and the establishment of documented best practices that can serve as examples for police departments nationwide.</p>
<p>Like many police departments, Camden wants to use smarter, more data-driven ways of improving community policing efforts and reducing uses of force. However, challenges with technology systems often get in the way. For instance, the Camden County PD cobbles together 41 systems that have individual value but are not designed to work together, requiring their beat officers to enter the same data multiple times. In this environment, meaningful data analysis ends up being extremely difficult to conduct, requiring analysts to spend more time on extracting the data than on critical analysis.</p>
<p>The President’s Police Data Initiative has assembled a volunteer team of technology experts who are also in Camden today. The team will spend two days in Camden on a design sprint, engaging directly with front line officers, detectives, crime analysts and department leadership to help envision what a truly effective technology system could look like. The two-day deployment will help the team consider best practices and address specific technology questions as they arise, enabling departments like Camden to find the solutions that most fit their needs.</p>
<p>By upgrading its technology practices, the Camden County PD will have more efficient data supply chains, and will be better positioned to use that data to improve its internal operations and to identify and solve policing problems in a more timely manner. The lessons learned in Camden can help law enforcement around the country both by example and also directly since some of the development work can be shared though open source best practice.</p>
<p>Camden is just one of 21 communities currently participating in our Police Data Initiative. Through this effort, local police departments and other participants are responding first to Task Force recommendations within two streams of work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using open data to increase transparency, build community trust, and support innovation</li>
<li>Better using technology, such as early warning systems, to identify problems, increase internal accountability, and decrease inappropriate uses of force</li>
</ul>
<p>The effort has focused on specific actions law enforcement agencies can take to make progress in these two areas. The collaboration has generated multiple commitments to action and the White House is working with agencies and key enabling partners now to drive quick implementation.</p>

<p><em>Graphic created by Presidential Innovation Fellow Christopher Wong</em></p>
<p>Commitment highlights include:</p>
<p><strong>1. Use open data to build transparency and increase community trust.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All 21 police departments have committed to release a combined total of 101 data sets that have not been released to the public. The types of data include uses of force, police pedestrian and vehicle stops, officer involved shootings and more, helping the communities gain visibility into key information on police/citizen encounters.
<ul>
<li>Code for America and others are helping on this. For information on how Police Departments can jumpstart their open police data efforts, <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2015/05/17/5-ways-to-jumpstart-the-release-of-open-data-on-policing/">click here</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To make police open data easy to find and use, the Police Foundation and ESRI are building a public safety open data portal to serve, in part, as a central clearinghouse option for police open data, making it easily accessible to law enforcement agencies, community groups and researchers.</li>
<li>Code for America and CI Technologies will work together to build an open source software tool to make it easier for the 500+ U.S. law enforcement agencies using IA Pro police integrity software to extract and open up data.</li>
<li>To make it easier for agencies to share data with the public about policing, Socrata will provide technical assistance to cities and agencies who are working toward increased transparency.</li>
<li>To help this newly released data come alive for communities through mapping, visualizations and other tools, city leaders, non-profit organizations, and private sector partners will host open data hackathons in cities around the country. In New Orleans, Operation Spark, a non-profit organization that teaches at-risk New Orleans youth software development skills, will work with data opened by the New Orleans Police Department at a weeklong code academy.</li>
<li>Presidential Innovation Fellows working with the U.S. Chief Technology Officer and Chief Data Scientist will work collaboratively with key stakeholders, such as Code for America and the Sunlight Foundation, to develop and release an Open Data Playbook for police departments that they can use as a reference for open data best practices and case studies.</li>
<li>The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department is working with the Southern Coalition for Social Justice to use open data to provide a full picture of key policing activities, including stops, searches and use-of-force trends, information and demographics on neighborhoods patrolled, and more. This partnership will build on a website and tools already developed by the Southern Coalition for Justice which provide visualization and search functions to make this data easily accessible and understandable.</li>
<li>The International Association of Chiefs of Police, the Police Foundation, and Code for America have committed to helping grow a community of practice for law enforcement agencies and technologists around open data and transparency in police community interactions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Internal accountability and effective data analysis.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>While many police departments have systems in place, often called “early warning systems,” to identify officers who may be having challenges in their interactions with the public and link them with training and other assistance, there has been little to no research to determine which indicators are most closely linked to bad outcomes. To tackle this issue, twelve police departments committed to sharing data on police/citizen encounters with data scientists for in-depth data analysis, strengthening the ability of police to intervene early and effectively: Austin, TX; Camden, NJ; Charlotte, NC; Dallas, TX; Indianapolis, IN; Knoxville, TN; LA City; LA County; Louisville, KY; New Orleans, LA; Philadelphia, PA; and Richmond, CA.</li>
<li>The University of Chicago will provide a team of five data science fellows from the Eric and Wendy Schmidt Data Science for Social Good program to work with 3-4 police departments over a 14 week engagement, starting in late May, to begin to prototype data analysis tools that will help police departments identify the behaviors most indicative of later problems.</li>
<li>The Oakland Police Department, which has deployed body worn cameras for over four years, has partnered with a team of researchers at Stanford University to build automated tools to comb through the audio to surface police/citizen encounters that either went particularly poorly or went particularly well. This will allow the Oakland PD to quickly identify problems and also to lift up real world examples of the great police work that happens every day. The Stanford team is also researching ways that body worn camera data can be used to track and inform the effectiveness of training in the field, using the camera data to see whether the classroom experience translated effectively to encounters on the street.</li>
<li>The Department of Justice and the Police Data Initiative stakeholders will work with universities and other research partners to identify opportunities to coordinate body worn camera research to help avoid unintended overlap, maximize the coverage of research topics and increase cross-learning. Additionally, the Police Data Initiative will work with cutting-edge leaders in advanced video analysis to identify opportunities to help police departments maximize the value of the thousands of hours of video body worn cameras will produce.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are excited about the Police Data Initiative as a fast, tangible, collaborative response to recommendations of the Task Force on 21st Century Policing and we are glad that so many cities have stepped forward to work towards better use of data and technology in ways that will build community trust and impact.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>“Find out who your audience and users are, then figure out the best, easiest way to provide data to them.”</em></p>
<p>Last week, the Obama Administration focused on a specific climate risk – the risk to the food supply – and the ways data could be used to help increase “food resilience.” The goal is to make data, computational power, and analytic tools available to help food producers, distributors, and inspectors keep the food supply reliable and robust.</p>
<p>As part of that effort, last Friday the GovLab and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) co-hosted an Open Data Roundtable on food resilience to bring together government officials, companies, and nonprofits to improve the use of data on climate and agriculture. Like the Roundtable we hosted with the White House and the Department of Commerce in June, this event was designed to promote a dialogue between government agencies that supply data and the companies and organizations that use it. The ultimate goal of all our Roundtables is to make open government data more relevant, accessible, and actionable.<span id="more-53480"></span></p>
<p>While it may be a few weeks before all the suggestions from last Friday’s Open Data Roundtable at USDA are compiled into a report, companies and USDA officials came away with a better understanding of how public data is gathered, disseminated and processed by users.  The meeting was part of a series of discussions initiated by USDA.  Undersecretary and Chief Scientist Cathie Woteki, Deputy Undersecretary Ann Bartuska and Chief Information Officer (CIO) Cheryl Cook listened to and participated in discussions aimed at making it easier for crop, weather, soil and other information gathered by USDA to be provided to those who need it, here in America and abroad.</p>
<p>Some of the recommendations made by the group during two breakout sessions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Things change, so develop an ongoing dialogue between users and providers of the data. Reach out to users (customers) to determine <a href="http://blogs.usda.gov/2014/08/05/local-regional-data-added-to-usda-market-news/">what they value and what they use</a>.</li>
<li>Standardize data across sets so that, for example, the definition of something as simple as “corn” is universal.</li>
<li>Develop a better system to enable a searcher to get what he or she wants without having to sort through reams of data first.</li>
<li>Have a “crosscut” system to keep users from having to go to multiple agencies or places for portions of the data they need.  Provide “one stop” service.</li>
<li>Provide better service to those who request information under the Freedom of Information Act.</li>
<li>Standardize tables to make it easier for business to convert raw data into information it needs.</li>
<li>Create a “data concierge” to assist users, improve the search function of @data.gov.</li>
<li>Set long terms improvement goals and develop a roadmap to get there.  Improve geospatial data and make it the “highest quality possible.”</li>
<li>Build an app that provides a “real time” data alert system, which could also be employed by USDA and other government departments to share information with the public during times of crisis or disaster.</li>
<li>Leverage data that is already available, such as drought monitoring and let it be used for expanded purposes, such as predictive analysis to drive efficiencies and insight to create a smarter “AgriBusiness”.</li>
</ul>
<p>The White House recognized the value of the Open Data Roundtables in the <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/us_open_data_action_plan.pdf">U.S. Open Data Action Plan</a>, released on May 9, 2014, which described the Roundtables as helping to “support innovators and improve open data based on feedback.” The Plan notes that “Specific, actionable feedback from these sessions [the Roundtables] and others has the potential to improve descriptions, formats, and accessibility of government data.”</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the meeting, Dr. Woteki pledged to continue her effort to provide more, free access to USDA’s scholarship and data.  She noted that these efforts build on an Open Data event spearheaded by the G-8 countries at the World Bank over a year ago, and continued this week as African leaders from many nations came to Washington to discuss agricultural and other issues.  “Agriculture has a growing role in open data implementation, because we face a growing challenge to produce more food for more people, and to provide the services they expect,” said Dr. Woteki. “The only way to achieve this is through collaborative work, innovation sharing, and research.”  USDA CIO Cook talked about how data was crucial to her previous jobs with the State of Pennsylvania, then as a Federal official in the Clinton and Obama administrations.  “As someone who has been a data producer and a data user,” said Cook, “I understand the need to consolidate data so it can be used for multiple purposes to help our clients achieve their goals. We support public-private partnerships, open data and the need to know who is using our data and how, so we can serve them better.”</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>by Ellen Stofan. </em></p>
<p><em>(Mar 21, 2015)</em> Today I was honored to represent NASA at the <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2014/03/19/climate-data-initiative-launches-strong-public-and-private-sector-commitments">Climate Data Initiative launch</a> at the White House. Along with NOAA, Google, and many partners from other government agencies and the private sector, we opened the <a href="/climate">climate.data.gov</a> gateway with more than 100 curated, high-quality datasets, web services, and tools that can be used by local officials, emergency management personnel and innovators to help communities prepare for the effects of our changing climate change.</p>
<p>For decades, NASA has shown great leadership in assembling a one-stop-shop of space-based Earth science and climate change data. across all disciplines of Earth Systems Science. Given our experience with this type of large-scale data integration, we welcomed the challenge to take on a leadership role in the first phase of the Climate Data Initiative, which integrates government-wide federal datasets across all disciplines that may have an impact on <a href="http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/NaturalHazards/view.php?id=83299&amp;eocn=home&amp;eoci=nh">coastal flooding</a>, and to make these datasets easily available.</p>
<p>At NASA, we are working proactively to protect our own national assets along the coasts from the potential impacts of climate change. From Wallops Island, Virginia, to the Space Coast of Florida, we are bringing together our Earth science researchers and our strategic infrastructure managers to provide climate-related decision support in the face of sea level rise and other serious coastal changes. The launch of <a href="http://www.data.gov/climate/">climate.data.gov </a>opens the door for citizen scientists to get involved in this type of work, in support of coastal communities around the nation.</p>
<p>NASA has a long history of engaging generations of global citizens to use publicly available data to design creative solutions to improve life on Earth, and enable humans to live and work in space. At the Climate Data Initiative launch event, I was delighted to announce that today, NASA and NOAA are together launching a new opportunity for citizens to work with us on this very important topic of coastal flooding.</p>
<p>This coastal flooding challenge is part of NASA’s third <a href="https://2014.spaceappschallenge.org/">International Space Apps Challenge </a>&#8211; a two-day global mass collaboration event on April 12-13, 2014. During these two days, citizens around the world are invited to engage directly with NASA to develop awe-inspiring software, hardware, and data visualizations. Last year’s event involved more than 9,000 global participants in 83 locations. This year will introduce more than 60 robust challenges clustered in five themes: asteroids, Earth watch, human spaceflight, robotics, and space technology.</p>
<p><a href="https://2014.spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/coastal-inundation/">The Coastal Inundation In Your Community challenge </a>is one of four climate-related challenges using data provided by NASA, NOAA and EPA. It invites citizens, students, and all others to create data visualizations and simulations to help people understand their exposure to coastal-inundation hazards. Solutions developed through this challenge could have many potential impacts, including helping coastal businesses determine if they are currently at risk from coastal inundation, and if they will be impacted in the future due to sea level rise and coastal erosion.</p>
<p>I encourage you to roll up your sleeves and get involved in this challenging and energizing event by visiting spaceappschallenge.org.</p>
<p>The Coastal Inundation in Your Community challenge and today’s rollout of coastal flooding data sets are just the beginning. I look forward to the rollout of additional data sets in climate.data.gov, and the opportunity to continue working with this esteemed community of my colleagues at every level of government, our public and private-sector partners and the world’s citizen scientists. And I’m even more also excited about <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/earthrightnow/">NASA’s upcoming year of major Earth science milestones</a>, including the launch of five missions to study the most important planet in our solar system — ours.</p>
<p>At NASA, we are known for exploring new worlds with rovers on Mars, scientific experiments on the International Space Station, and a vast array of missions exploring our Sun, our neighboring planets and the distant universe. Of all the planets we have explored, none yet have matched the dynamic complexity of our own Earth.</p>
<p>We have a long history of exploring our home planet. For decades we have designed, built, and launched Earth-observing missions to return valuable information about this complex planet we call home. In 2014, we are building on this legacy with five new Earth-observing missions – more than NASA has conducted in a single year in over a decade. These missions will provide global measurements of precipitation, soil moisture, atmospheric carbon dioxide, winds, clouds and aerosols. Your planet is changing. We’re on it.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">This term “open data” is becoming increasingly commonplace. That’s what Data.gov is all about. But what is open data? A new article in the <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Paris Tech Review</em> offers a snapshot of how open data was born, its evolving purpose, and how it can make a difference in all our lives. “Open data” did not come out of thin air, and it’s interesting to discover its rich context.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">While the term “open data” isn’t even 20 years old, the author puts the concept in a historical context; the idea that scientific research should be free to all was popularized by Robert King Merton in the early 1940s. Research (which produces data) should be shared freely for the common good.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Fast forward to the early 21</span><sup><span style="font-size: small;">st</span></sup><span style="font-size: medium;"> century. Scientific culture intersects with the burgeoning Internet/Information Technology society. By this time, scientists and even the general public take for granted that scientific research should be available for the public good; in fact, debates arise around length of patent protection for certain products due in part to the assumption that research data is a public resource.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">In December 2007, in Sebastopol, California, a group of thought leaders gathered to discuss and define the concept of open public data. By this time, the open-source software movement was in full swing, with people collaborating, or &#8220;crowdsourcing,&#8221; software by using the Internet as their workspace. The product/software and its ongoing improvements were available for free and visible to everyone in real time via the Internet. Those who met in Sebastapol understood the Internet’s potential and the value of making data, particularly government data, understood and available as a public resource, just as our natural resources are shared for the common good. They actively promoted this idea.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">Less than two years later, on his first day in office, President Obama signed the </span><a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/transparency-and-open-government"><span style="color: #0000ff; font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">Memorandum on Transparency and Open Government</span></a>,<span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> stating,<span style="color: #333333; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;"> <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Information maintained by the Federal Government is a national asset. My Administration will take appropriate action, consistent with law and policy, to disclose information rapidly in forms that the public can readily find and use.</em></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">That May, Data.gov was born. As we look forward to our fourth birthday next month, we have learned a great deal – and we’re still on the learning curve. In a few weeks, we will unveil a new catalog and look forward to your feedback on it.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">In the meantime, check out “</span></span><a href="http://www.paristechreview.com/2013/03/29/brief-history-open-data/"><span style="color: #0000ff; font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">A Brief History of Open Data</span></a><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">” in the <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Paris Tech Review.</em></span></span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Submitted by Jim Hendler, Head, Department of Computer Science, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Theresa A. Pardo, Director, Center for Technology in Government, Associate Research Professor, Public Administration and Policy and Informatics, University at Albany, State University of New York.</p>
<p>Government agencies are investing in strategies to increase access to information created, collected, and held by government. While these strategies typically involve placing information on the web, they sometimes exhibit a misunderstanding of the importance of providing that information in “machine readable” formats. The degree to which information is machine readable, however, is critical to meeting priorities such as open government and open data, and directly influences, and in many cases limits, the uses citizens and other interested parties can make of that information.</p>
<p>Historically, efforts to make government information available to the public have focused on pushing static information about government programs and services to the web. The intended user has been a human who can read, print, and take actions based on reading the material or by engaging in a form-based transaction. In some cases, users were able to query the data or map the results using sophisticated geospatial displays. Access to the data itself, on the other hand, was rarely provided.</p>
<p>This historical practice has been dictated in large part by the capabilities of familiar web technologies (such as HTML and PDF) and a narrow vision of the expected users and uses of the information. Machine readable formats expand that field of vision to new users and new uses and require technologies (such as RDF, XML, and JSON) that may be less familiar in this context, but are still proven and widely used in other arenas (such as web services and content management). Taking the next step to machine readable formats requires government agencies to fully appreciate the potential uses of government information as well as the range of possible formats and the implications of those formats on intended use.</p>
<p>So where to begin? An important starting point is to understand that “machine readable” is not synonymous with “digitally accessible” information.  Scanning a report, the text, graphics, or even rows and columns of numbers, makes it digitally accessible, but a computer still is not really able to “understand” the information. This distinction can be seen in the difference between a magazine cover and a barcode on that cover. A computer cannot directly understand what the picture on the magazine represents, even if it is presented in an online format, but it can read and understand the bar code, using it for identifying the price and tracking the purchase, for example.</p>
<p>Let’s consider the significance of that bar code – a machine readable format that’s universally embedded in products and documents today, but was virtually unseen just 40 years ago. What are some factors that account for its prevalence now?</p>
<ul>
<li>Uniformity &#8211; The standard format of the UPC (Universal Product Code) established in the 1970’s made widespread adoption possible as tools for printing and processing the UPC could develop around an accepted model.</li>
<li>Simplicity – The bar code itself is a rather unobtrusive symbol that today has relatively little impact on its attached product. Consumers barely notice it and it’s created without much additional effort.</li>
<li>Ubiquity – The bar code, which was introduced for grocery store items, now appears on virtually every item that can be purchased or distributed.</li>
<li>Economy – The cost savings realized through faster, more accurate transaction processing made the bar code a worthwhile investment. The savings soon extended to better inventory management, customer relationships, and theft control (you can’t switch bar codes as easily as you can switch price tags).</li>
<li>Extensibility – The types and amount of data that could be stored and processed via bar codes expanded its application to areas such as health care (for tracking patient and medication information in hospital settings), distribution (for tracking and expediting shipping and mailing), and scientific research (for banding birds and other wildlife) to name just a few.</li>
</ul>
<p>Similar factors are now coming into play with the advent of machine readable formats for government data. The expectation of similar benefits in usability, payback, and extensibility should provide the motivation. To realize these benefits, similar conditions also apply. Uniformity and standardization in data formats and processing are needed. Simplicity in creating and embedding the formats must be achieved. Cost advantages must be realized through their use to justify their creation. When these conditions are met, machine readable data become more prevalent leading in turn to increased capabilities.</p>
<p>For these reasons and as commitments to open government and transparency increase, efforts to make information available must include machine readable versions of datasets and not only reports about this information in document form (such as PDF, HTML, and JPG).  Consider a bar chart in a government report. You can read the report in PDF format and understand the analysis the chart provides. However, neither the chart itself nor its underlying data is available in a way that allows further processing of that information. Next generation efforts in opening government must ensure that users have access, for example, not just to a static bar chart image, but also to information about the source of that bar chart and the underlying data itself, much as the magazine bar code described above reveals far more data about the magazine that can be leveraged for additional benefits.</p>
<p>In a practical sense, machine readable information helps government agencies to bridge the gap between “documents” (which are typically static and frozen in their format) and “data” (which may be dynamic and can be open to further processing). By adopting a machine readable perspective, these same agencies can meet their open government and open data objectives more completely, reliably, and responsibly.</p>
<p>Further implications of “documents” versus “data” and the various levels of machine readability, along with the conditions required for broader and deeper implementation, are far beyond the scope of this paper which intends to provide a basic awareness of the main components of machine readable information. To aid in that awareness, the following sections briefly outline the characteristics and differences between documents and data and take a quick look at the special case of syndication formats. It concludes with a glossary of relevant terms. Subsequent papers will address the issues surrounding machine readability and related policies in greater detail.</p>
<p><strong><em>Machine Readability for Text Documents</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>PDF (Portable Document Format) </strong>is the primary format used to make government information available to the public in document form. While PDF has made it possible for many documents to be available on the web, simply providing a PDF report does not fully address the need to have information about the document itself or its underlying data. For example, the PDF does not necessarily indicate who authored it, where it came from, or the nature of its content. This type of information about the document is often referred to as the “metadata” for the document. Much as a bar code contains additional data about a product, this metadata provides additional data that can assist citizens and researchers searching by a particular author or on a particular topic. Without access to metadata on the thousands of government documents on the web, citizens are essentially looking for a needle in a haystack. There are a number of tools available to extract that kind of information from many kinds of PDF documents and to make it available for use by application developers to ensure that data is available for searching by citizens and others. Thus, PDF documents are a step towards machine readability, but are most useful when enhanced with appropriate metadata.</p>
<p><strong>XML (eXtensible Markup Language) </strong>was developed for several purposes, one of which is to make the metadata of documents more directly available.  XML, when properly used, tags information in a document so that computers can automatically extract it to help provide users with capabilities such as searching, browsing, and information discovery.  Along these lines, an important emerging property of XML involves providing mechanisms for tracking versions of a document.  When used, it allows the history of a document to be made available to others — an important capability for tracking legislation, policy guidance, and decision memos.</p>
<p>Producing quality metadata is pivotal to the ability of search tools to find a particular document in response to particular queries. XML does not produce metadata, but is a tool to make it available for use. Producing metadata and then ensuring its use through languages such as XML falls to the document owners and producers and the technologists who support them.</p>
<p><strong><em>Machine Readability for Data</em></strong></p>
<p>Machine readability directly influences data usability. Datasets, in particular very large datasets, on their own convey little information to a human. Only when that data is processed in some way — visualized, analyzed, or summarized — does it becomes informative or useful. Thus, to fully realize the potential of open government data, government agencies must release their data in a format that allows processing.  Providing innovators, journalists, and other end users with data in this way makes it possible for them to better understand the raw data, to examine it in ways that meet their interests and responds to their questions. It allows them to drive their businesses; in some cases it becomes their businesses.</p>
<p>The most common machine readable format for data is “Comma Separated Variables” (CSV), which is provided directly by many standard database and spreadsheet products.  CSV stores tabular data in a text-based format, making it easily exchanged by machines.  CSV, like XML for documents, does not inherently make metadata available. There are a number of metadata formats being developed for use along with CSV, but currently these tend to be defined by those developing open data websites, rather than the data providers themselves.</p>
<p>A general problem with CSV is that because it is primarily text-based, it makes it difficult for computers to find common elements between datasets.  If one dataset has a value of “Alaska” and another has one of “AK” then separate information must be retained somewhere that can link these things to each other.  The term “linked data” and the emerging Resource Description Framework (RDF) standard are designed to both enhance the capability of datasets to have their metadata directly attached and also to allow common terms to be related throughout datasets. These features of RDF are making it increasingly attractive for modern open data sites.</p>
<p><strong><em>Syndication Formats </em></strong></p>
<p>When information is published in machine readable formats, that information, and especially its metadata, can be shared via “syndication” that enables automatic, continuous feeds of information.  A user, using any one of a number of applications, can request that the information be “pushed” to their machine.  Common syndication formats, such as RSS, Atom and JSON are thus used for sharing machine readable documents, but are not themselves machine readability solutions. They can be viewed more accurately as beneficial outcomes of machine readability, an outcome that most people are familiar with today.</p>
<p><strong><em>A Glossary for Machine Readability</em></strong></p>
<p>The following glossary provides basic definitions for terms and acronyms that you may encounter when investigating machine readability. They are arranged alphabetically, not by topic or theme.</p>
<p><strong>API: </strong>(Application Programming Interface) When information is made available in any machine readable format, it becomes possible to make that information directly available to programs that request that information over the web.  An API is the way this information is made directly available to other machines.</p>
<p><strong>Atom: </strong>Atom is a machine syndication format based on XML.  It is widely used in applications that publish documents or news items, and then syndicate the basic metadata about that document (title, authors, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>CSV: </strong>(Comma separated values) A format that stores tabular data (numbers and text) in plain-text form. CSV is an open format and is widely used to store and organize tabular data. Most open government data sites use CSV as the data release format.</p>
<p><strong>Digital Formats</strong>: Any format that can be stored, viewed and shared by a computer. While all machine readable formats are also digital formats, not all digital formats are machine readable.</p>
<p><strong>Five-star (linked open) Data: </strong>Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, proposed a rating scheme for open government data.  He suggested that making data available online was one star, making it machine readable was two-stars, using an open-format was three stars, using RDF format was four stars, and using RDF with links to other datasets was five stars.</p>
<p><strong>HTML</strong>:  (HyperText Markup Language) The main markup language for displaying web pages and other information in a web browser. HTML is an open standard by the W3C. The tags and markup of HTML mainly relate to how information is displayed to a human user, not to the information itself. In general, putting a document in HTML, without some form of tagging or metadata, is not considered making it machine readable in a useful sense.</p>
<p><strong>JSON</strong>: (JavaScript Object Notation) A machine readable data format derived from the JavaScript language used on many web sites.  It is used for representing simple data structures and associative arrays. As a data serialization format it is language and machine independent. JSON is an open format and is defined in RFC 4627. JSON is also used by Facebook as a way of publishing public social-networking information, which is increasing its use in datasharing and syndication applications.</p>
<p><strong>Metadata</strong>: Machine readable data is most useful when information about who produced it, when, etc. is associated with the data. Both documents and structured datasets require metadata to be searchable, sharable, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Open Format: </strong>The U.S. Government through the Open Government Directive (<a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/omb/assets/memoranda_2010/m10-06.pdf">http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/assets/memoranda_2010/m10-06.pdf</a>) defines an open format as “one that is platform independent, machine readable, and made available to the public without restrictions that would impede the re-use of that information.” All of the formats discussed in this document are Open Formats.</p>
<p><strong>PDF</strong>: (Portable Document Format) A file format used mainly to represent documents such that layout will stay the same independent of the system environment. As of 2008, Adobe released the PDF format as an open standard. PDF is mainly a human readable format, concerned with layout and organization. Tools for connecting metadata to PDF or extracting the text from it make PDF more machine readable than many other document formats.</p>
<p><strong>RDF: </strong>(Resource Description Framework) A data language used to represent data and information as web resources so that the can be “linked” together. RDF is an open standard from the W3C. RDF is increasing in popularity as a data release language as it allows common terms to be linked between datasets.</p>
<p><strong>RSS: </strong>(Really Simple Syndication) An XML (or RDF) based language used to publish frequently updated works. Includes both content and metadata about the content (i.e., author and date). An RSS feed is a common syndication method for sharing documents published on the web.</p>
<p><strong>Schema.org</strong>: Schema.org is a way of embedding metadata about common objects into other web documents. It is supported by Bing, Google, Yahoo! and other web search engines.  Use of Schema.org enhances the ability of search engines to find machine readable documents and to optimize their search rank.  Use of schema.org is an increasingly important enhancement to machine readable documents due to its role in increasing Search Engine Optimization for online resources.</p>
<p><strong>Syndication Formats</strong>: Digital formats used to help publish continuous feeds of information.</p>
<p><strong>XML: </strong>(eXtensible Markup Language) A markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that can be both human and machine readable. XML is an open format created and maintained by the W3C. XML is enhanced by proper use of XML schemas or by use of metadata embedded in the XML.</p>

]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Technology evolves rapidly, and it can be challenging for policy and its implementation to evolve at the same pace.  Last week, President Obama launched the Administration’s new <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/memoranda/2013/m-13-13.pdf" target="_blank">Open Data Policy</a> and <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/09/executive-order-making-open-and-machine-readable-new-default-government-" target="_blank">Executive Order</a>aimed at ensuring that data released by the government will be as accessible and useful as possible.  To make sure this tech-focused policy can keep up with the speed of innovation, we created <a href="http://project-open-data.github.io/" target="_blank">Project Open Data</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-516"></span></p>
<p>Project Open Data is an online, public repository intended to foster collaboration and promote the continual improvement of the Open Data Policy. We wanted to foster a culture change in government where we embrace collaboration and where anyone can help us make open data work better. The project is published on <a href="http://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, an open source platform that allows communities of developers to collaboratively share and enhance code.  The resources and plug-and-play tools in Project Open Data can help accelerate the adoption of open data practices.  For example, one tool instantly converts spreadsheets and databases into APIs for easier consumption by developers.  The idea is that anyone, from Federal agencies to state and local governments to private citizens, can freely use and adapt these open source tools—and that’s exactly what’s happening.</p>
<p>Within the first 24 hours after Project Open Data was published, more than two dozen contributions (or “pull requests” in GitHub speak) were submitted by the public. The submissions included everything from fixing broken links, to providing policy suggestions, to contributing new code and tools. One pull request even included new code that translates geographic data from locked formats into open data that is freely available for use by anyone.</p>
<p>These steps may seem small, but they represent a big shift. Behind these actions is recognition of the simple fact that, as a community, we can do more together than we can alone. Project Open Data leverages the ingenuity of innovators everywhere as partners to help the country realize the full benefit of open data.</p>
<p>We are excited to test this new model of policy refinement and implementation. We invite you to add your own contributions to Project Open Data, and hope you will participate in helping to transform our government for the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p>
<p><em>Here’s how Project Open Data works:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Contributing:  </strong>Project Open Data is a collaborative, open source project.  Both Federal employees and members of the public are strongly encouraged to improve the project by contributing.  Fortunately, contributing is very easy. Simply click the “Improve this content” button at the top of every page, make your edit, and hit “submit.” Your changes will appear once they are approved. Additional instructions can be found <a href="http://project-open-data.github.io/faq/" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Owners:</strong> Project Open Data is managed by the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). As the Federal CIO and CTO, we both plan to be actively involved in this exciting project and are looking forward to merging many more “pull requests” along the way. Members of our teams will also be involved in maintaining the project.</li>
<li><strong>Approving changes:</strong>  In GitHub speak, Project Open Data is actually a <em>collection</em> of different little-p “projects” housed in individual repositories, or “repos.” Each individual project repo will be managed as an open source project – i.e., users can make pull requests (suggest changes).  A repo manager will adjudicate the pull requests (accept, modify, or reject) in a public log on a standard release cycle. Changes to relevant policy areas will be reviewed and approved by relevant policy officials.  We will document and carry out these conversations within Project Open Data through issues and comments.</li>
<li><strong>Timing:</strong> White House owners will have regular “stand ups” to review the pull requests and ensure suggestions are addressed in a reasonable time frame.  Changes that are relatively minor (e.g., typos, minor edits) should be approved fairly quickly, while more substantial changes may take longer to review and approve with necessary White House stakeholders.</li>
</ul>

<p><img loading="lazy" style="width: 180px; height: 189px; padding-left: 20px; float: right;" title="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/bsp-ocsit-prod-east-appdata/datagov/wordpress/2013/10/opendata_20110705_1_1.jpg" alt="Sonny Bhagowalia at his farewell party" height="189" width="180">This will be my final blog entry as Program Executive for Data.gov, as I am departing to become the Chief Information Officer for the State of Hawaii. There, Governor Abercrombie and I will work together to bring Hawaii’s data forward and look at ways to continue to collaborate with this team and with all of you. In Hawaiian, “Aloha” means many things, including “Hello,” “Goodbye,” and “Good luck,” so as I depart for the Islands, I wish all of you a fond farewell and the best of luck in the future.</p>
<p><!--break--></p>
<h3 style="clear: both;">Top Performer</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="width: 120px; height: 94px; padding-right: 20px; float: left;" title="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/bsp-ocsit-prod-east-appdata/datagov/wordpress/2013/10/images/opendata_20110705_2.jpg" alt="a meter showing a score of 9.9 out of 10" height="94" width="120"></p>
<p>The last few months have been busy and exciting ones for Data.gov.&nbsp; We continue to make great strides in technical capability and outreach efforts to spread the message of open government data.&nbsp;Data.gov has achieved an overall rating of 9.9 out of 10 on the IT Dashboard, one of the highest in federal government.&nbsp; We have also received numerous awards, such as being named a finalist in the 2011 ACT-IAC Excellence.gov awards, and being named to CIO Magazine’s annual CIO 100 Awards, as one of the 100 innovative organizations that uses IT effectively to create business value, one of only 4 awarded to the Federal government.</p>
<h3>Data.gov Next Generation is Successfully Underway, Data.gov Classic Continues</h3>
<p>In May 2011, Data.gov launched Data.gov Next Generation, which transforms the site from simply an online catalog to a cloud-based data services platform that provides benefits in the areas of <em>citizen experience</em>, <em>developer enablement,</em> and <em>agency empowerment.&nbsp; </em>Rather than going to another site to download the data, you can get to the data right away to analyze, sort, group, and visualize the data live, via the cloud.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="width: 700px; height: 291px;" title="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/bsp-ocsit-prod-east-appdata/datagov/wordpress/2013/10/images/opendata_20110705_3.jpg" alt="a screenshot of the Data.gov Next Generation" height="291" width="700"></p>
<p><a href="http://explore.data.gov/Information-and-Communications/Central-Contractor-Registration-CCR-FOIA-Extract/3hqn-qzh6">Click here for an example</a>. Transforming data into information puts the data to work, allowing citizens to be more informed, make better decisions, and derive greater value from their government.&nbsp; The datasets on the new platform also feature an open application programming interface (API), making it easier for developers to mash up data and create apps. For fans of the old Data.gov, fear not! The “Classic” version of the catalog will remain available and continue to be updated as new datasets are added.</p>
<h3>Communities Are the Future</h3>
<p>We continue to add to Data.gov Communities, which provide citizens, government, researchers, and industry with a forum to share ideas and feedback about data on topics that are important to the American public and that tie into the missions of many agencies.&nbsp; Communities provide discussion forums and opportunities for collaboration and innovation among data consumers, and help to make data more accessible and more relevant by giving users a view of the catalog tailored to their particular interests.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="width: 200px; height: 209px; padding-right: 20px; float: left;" title="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/bsp-ocsit-prod-east-appdata/datagov/wordpress/2013/10/images/opendata_20110705_4.jpg" alt="a screenshot of the Energy.data.gov webpage" height="209" width="200">On June 30, 2011, we launched our latest community, <a href="http://www.data.gov/communities/energy">Energy.Data.gov</a>.&nbsp; The Energy Community is aimed at increasing awareness and improving insight into our Nation’s energy performance, bringing together datasets, tools, and applications using data about energy and how it is used.&nbsp; Data about alternative fuels, energy efficient buildings, and how to conserve energy at home are available to empower Americans to understand energy issues, including the energy use of the federal government.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These new innovations are a challenge as we have experienced dramatic cuts to the eGov fund and the Data.gov budgets.&nbsp; However, in a new paradigm, these communities and some additional services are moving forward because of reimbursements from agencies that support the initiatives and goals of these new communities.&nbsp; Stay tuned as the Data.gov team, working with other agencies, brings up new communities that focus on the interests of the American public.</p>
<h3>Geospatial Integration is Coming Soon</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="width: 700px; height: 266px;" title="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/bsp-ocsit-prod-east-appdata/datagov/wordpress/2013/10/images/opendata_20110705_5.jpg" alt="popular maps from geodata.gov" height="266" width="700"></p>
<p>This summer, we will merge Geospatial One Stop (geodata.gov) into Data.gov to consolidate the Federal government’s two primary data catalogs into one site. Bringing the two sites into one will simplify citizens&#8217; search for data, whether geospatial or tabular, while still providing the same visualization (e.g. mapping) capabilities that currently exist at Geospatial One Stop. The consolidation will also save money by eliminating the need for the technical infrastructure of an independent Geospatial One Stop, and by providing citizens and agencies alike with a single source for all federal civilian geospatial data.</p>
<h3>The Future is Bright</h3>
<p>In the next several months, Data.gov will continue to transform and grow.&nbsp; Additional Communities are in development, and Data.gov Next Generation will host more and more of the federal agencies’ datasets, so that the government’s data is available in a format that is more useful to citizens, researchers and developers.&nbsp; As Data.gov continues to improve, it will maintain its position as a world leader in open government data.&nbsp; Be part of this journey—explore the data, share what you learn, and help to deliver the power of understanding through visualizations, apps, and analyses.</p>
<h3>Thanks for the Memories</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="width: 300px; height: 200px; padding-left: 20px; float: right;" title="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/bsp-ocsit-prod-east-appdata/datagov/wordpress/2013/10/images/opendata_20110705_6-1.jpg" alt="Federal CIO Vivek Kundra presenting a letter of appreciation to Sonny Bhagowalia" height="200" width="300">I would like to thank everyone who attended my Hawaiian-themed farewell party for their kind words and best wishes. The event was a wonderful send-off, and I am grateful for the appearance by the Federal CIO, Vivek Kundra, as well as other Department and Agency CIOs who attended.</p>
<p>In my time as Data.gov Program Executive, I have had an incredible team of over-achievers supporting me – they are the real heroes and heroines of Data.gov and the Open Gov movement. Marion Royal, Hyon Kim, Alan Vandermallie, and Sally Kiel from GSA, Joey Hutcherson from Commerce, George Thomas from HHS, and Jeanne Holm from NASA have all been key to the success of Data.gov and it has been my pleasure to have worked with each of them. Dr. Jim Hendler from the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and Nick Harrigan, Hiko Naito, and the rest of our contractor team have been superb and provided world-class support. It’s been great to be part of the Data.gov team and the global Open Government phenomenon.</p>
<p>Aloha and Mahalo!<br />Sonny</p>

<p>Every day, people around the world use data to make decisions.  When heading out of town, most of us use weather apps to check the forecast anywhere in the world before packing our bags.  However, when we travel to far-flung places, we may find ourselves packing food from home because we don’t know what may be available when we arrive.  We have a global, comprehensive, open data set that enables weather forecasting, but not something similar for food and agriculture?</p>
<p>In his first public remarks as head of USDA, Secretary Sonny Perdue noted that “…we want to make decisions based on facts and evidence,” “we want to be data-driven,” and “I need good data, I need good sound science to make decisions on…”</p>
<p>USDA recognizes that farmers, ranchers, and consumers alike &#8211; use data daily, from deciding when to plant, harvest or sell their crops, when to turn out cattle to pasture, or where to buy fresh fruits and vegetables.  This is why it is important that data be made available, open and accessible, to facilitate the best-informed decisions.</p>
<p>Around the world, a movement called the “open data revolution” is under way to make data available for public use.  This movement is expected to generate new insights, drive better decision-making, and enable governments, civil society, and the private sector to better target interventions and programs.</p>
<p>All of this is why the U.S. Government, led by USDA, was a founding partner of the Global Open Data for Agriculture and Nutrition (GODAN) initiative and why it continues to support the advancement of open data for agriculture and nutrition around the world.  Now with over 500 partners, GODAN continues to support the sharing of available, accessible, and usable open data for agriculture and nutrition to help ensure global food security.</p>
<p>If we’re going to feed over 9 billion people by 2050, we need open data policies to make decisions based on facts and evidence. This global perspective will help identify data already available and data gaps that exist, and sharpen the focus on how open data can foster innovation and collaborative research, creating whole new kinds of growth around the world.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When viewed from the shore the ocean may seem like a boundless resource with plenty of space, but the reality is quite different.  Coastal areas are home to shipping lanes used by commercial vessels, attractive fish habitat that supports commercial and recreational fisheries,  underground utility cables connecting people with essential services, and a variety of animals that fly and swim.  In the midst of all this activity <a href="https://marinecadastre.gov/">MarineCadastre.Gov</a> was born.  Originally designed to provide technical support for renewable energy siting in the ocean, <a href="https://marinecadastre.gov/">MarineCadastre.Gov </a>now serves up a wealth of data used to inform ocean and Great Lakes planning.  A variety of federal agencies act as <a href="https://marinecadastre.gov/about/">data providers for MarineCadastre.Gov</a>, including science, regulatory, and law enforcement offices.  Users can find pre-made maps on topics such as renewable energy, offshore shipwrecks, and fishing vessel density, or they can make custom maps with the <a href="https://marinecadastre.gov/viewers/">free online map viewer</a>.  Many of the maritime datasets used to make online maps through MarineCadastre.Gov are also available for free download through Data.Gov, including datasets related to marine transportation such as:</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its seventh year as home to the U.S. Government&#8217;s open data, Data.gov continues to serve millions of people worldwide, from researchers and civic hackers, to businesses and citizens. These users have created apps, launched new products and services, and have improved transparency and openness, making the U.S. Government more accountable and responsive to the American people. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://datausa.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data USA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an online application developed by a team of data scientists at MIT Media Lab and Datawheel, backed by Deloitte is helping Americans visualize demographic and economic data using an open source platform. </span><a href="http://www.where-are-the-jobs.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where are the Jobs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, another online application developed by SymSoft Solutions provides insights on employment trends and salary information by geographic data. The application </span><a href="https://www.dol.gov/opa/media/press/opa/opa20111568.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">won </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">first place at the U.S. Department of Labor&#8217;s 2011 Occupational Employment Statistics Challenge. Data.gov was the subject of researchers Rashmi Krishnamurthy and Yukika Awazu in their </span><a href="https://www.data.gov/meta/liberating-data-for-public-value-the-case-of-data-gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">paper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “Liberating data for public value: The case of Data.gov,” </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">International Journal of Information Management</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (2016). </span><a href="http://farmplenty.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FarmPlenty</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, recipient of the USDA-Microsoft Innovation Challenge Grand Prize award, uses open government data to helps farmers better analyze U.S. Department of Agriculture data on crops grown within a five mile radius of their farms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data.gov&#8217;s influence reaches across borders. The Data.gov Help Desk receives numerous requests from U.S. and foreign residents seeking open data insights, technical information, and advice on how to encourage their governments (national, state, local, and tribal) to introduce and improve their open data platforms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The future of open data is promising because of the collaborative efforts of partners in the private and public sectors. This year, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and the Center for Open Data Enterprise launched the Open Data </span><a href="http://opendataenterprise.org/open-data-roundtables.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roundtables</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to identify open data case studies, learned lessons, and best practices across the Federal government; strengthen a community of technical, legal, and policy experts in support of open data; and support continuity and accelerate the progress of open data work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open government data is a team effort, so we ask you to join us and help improve the next year of Data.gov!</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to ocean planning, there are multiple user groups, activity types, natural resources, and physical forces to consider.  In the face of such complexity, local planning efforts can benefit from federally funded consistent data collection and sharing, especially when involving fluid resources that cross jurisdictional boundaries.  Regional councils create a space where state and federal groups can collaborate to support use and conservation of ocean resources through informed ocean planning.  For the <a href="http://northeastoceancouncil.org/">Northeast Regional Ocean Council</a> (NROC), providing high quality data through the<a href="http://www.northeastoceandata.org/"> Northeast Ocean Data portal </a>is an essential part of stakeholder outreach, collaboration, and education. The Northeast Ocean Data portal serves up spatial data on maritime topics ranging from <a href="http://www.northeastoceandata.org/data-explorer/?aquaculture">aquaculture </a>and essential fish habitat to marine <a href="http://www.northeastoceandata.org/data-explorer/?marine-transportation">transportation</a> and <a href="http://www.northeastoceandata.org/data-explorer/?national-security">national security,</a> many of which are derived from datasets made available through Data.Gov.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For many Americans, maritime transportation plays a role in their daily commute to work. Understanding usage patterns and operational expenditures at different ferry operators can help transportation planners learn more about how ferries are used in different parts of the U.S., and how ferries can support economic activity in a region by providing important transportation options. The U.S. Department of Transportation makes the results of the biennial National Census of Ferry Operators available online. Users interested in querying the historical database of ferry information can visit the Bureau of Transportation Statistics to use the query tool at: https://www.ncfodatabase.bts.gov/ncfodb/NCFO_DQ.jsp&#8217;</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">The 2016 Open Data Roundtables</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">The Open Data Roundtables were gatherings to identify<br />
case studies, lessons learned, and best practices in open data across the Federal government.</p>
<h3>PURPOSE</h3>
<p>The Roundtables supported the Federal goal to responsibly unleash government data for the benefit of the American public and maximize the nation’s return on its investment in data.</p>
<h3>WHY OPEN DATA?</h3>
<p>Open data from government is free, publicly-available data that anyone can use and republish. This important public resource has helped <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/02/05/open-data-empowering-americans-make-data-driven-decisions">Americans find better value for college, fair housing, and safer medicines</a>. In addition, it helps government agencies operate more efficiently, share information, and engage the citizens they serve.</p>
<h3>ABOUT THE 2016 OPEN DATA ROUNDTABLES.</h3>
<p>Federal agencies face many obstacles in making their data as accessible and usable as possible. Agencies have been working on these goals and the Roundtables helped identify scalable solutions across the government.</p>
<p>The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and the Center for Open Data Enterprise hosted four Open Data Roundtables in 2016. The Roundtables were designed to achieve the following goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify open data case studies, learned lessons, and best practices across the Federal government;</li>
<li>Strengthen a community of technical, legal, and policy experts in support of open data; and</li>
<li>Support continuity and accelerate the progress of open data work.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Roundtables brought together participants from Federal agencies, academia, the private sector, and nonprofit organizations. The Roundtables included experts on all aspects of open data with technical, policy, and legal backgrounds to identify case studies, lessons learned, and best practices.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Interested in seeing where and when hurricanes might have affected commercial navigation or port activities around the world? The NOAA Historical Hurricane Tracks online tool allows anyone to search and view storm tracks as far back as 1848. Only want the want to find the worst storms? Historical Hurricane Tracks website has filters that let users search by storm intensity, name, location, or other criteria. For people interested in port resilience, maritime history, economic impacts of hurricanes, or where marine transportation system infrastructure faces some pretty powerful weather challenges this dataset is a great starting place.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As intermodal connectors for domestic and international freight, our nation’s ports serve a critical role in numerous supply chains and the national economy. In recognition of this importance, the <em>Fixing America&#8217;s Surface Transportation</em> (FAST) Act (P.L. 114-94; Dec. 4, 2015; 129 Stat. 1312) established a Port Performance Freight Statistics Program within the U.S. Department of Transportation: Bureau of Transportation Statistics. The first annual Port Performance Freight Statistics Program report provides descriptive statistics for a group of ports for year 2016, including the top 25 ports in terms of total tonnage, twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs), and dry bulk tonnage. The report is available to download at <a href="https://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/sites/rita.dot.gov.bts/files/PPFS_Annual_Report.pdf"><u>https://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/sites/rita.dot.gov.bts/files/PPFS_Annual_Report.pdf</u></a></p>
<p>The 2016 Port Performance report used multiple sources, including public datasets featured on Data.Gov. One foundational dataset used in the report is the total commercial tonnage carried on waterways published by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers – Waterborne Commerce Statistics Center.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data.gov recently completed migration to a new infrastructure. The change will make the Data.gov program more efficient and enable development of new capabilities for site users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For most users of Data.gov, there should be no impact. For users of Data.gov, Geoplatform.gov and inventory.data.gov with  access to edit web page content, harvest metadata records, or manage metadata records, there are some important changes in the new infrastructure, in particular the integration of Data.gov with </span><a href="https://max.omb.gov/maxportal/home.do"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OMB MAX</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for account login authentication, as described in more detail below:</span></p>
<p><b>Data.gov (WordPress):</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All users who have accounts on Data.gov and signed on previously through </span><a href="http://idp.geoplatform.gov"><span style="font-weight: 400;">http://idp.geoplatform.gov</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will now use </span><a href="https://login.max.gov/cas/login?service=https%3A%2F%2Fmax.gov%2Fmaxportal%2Fsa%2Flogin.action%3Bjsessionid%3D994E6FE4CC968B89D599672C9F9DDAAE"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OMB MAX login</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you have an account on Data.gov to modify content on the main Data.gov page or a topic page, you will be sent to OMB MAX upon your first login. You should </span><a href="https://login.max.gov/cas/login?service=https%3A%2F%2Fmax.gov%2Fmaxportal%2Fsa%2Flogin.action%3Bjsessionid%3D994E6FE4CC968B89D599672C9F9DDAAE"><span style="font-weight: 400;">log in to OMB MAX</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with your OMB MAX credentials on your first use of the “new” Data.gov. Two-factor authentication (2FA) is now required for Data.gov access, so enable 2FA through the instructions on the OMB MAX log in page. You can add a device by clicking on &#8220;Manage SMS 2-Factor Devices&#8221; under your profile settings. This is not necessary if you use your PIV/CAC card to log in to MAX; it is already considered 2FA. After you have logged in to OMB MAX, email us at </span><a href="mailto:datagov@gsa.gov"><span style="font-weight: 400;">datagov@gsa.gov</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to let us know that you have completed the initial login. In the email provide the Topic name and access permission (Admin or Editor) required. We will then associate requested permissions to your account. On subsequent logins to Data.gov (through OMB MAX), you should be able to perform the actions you have privileges for on Data.gov without further assistance.</span></p>
<p><b>Data.gov (Catalog &#8211; CKAN) </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data.gov accounts for managing the Data.gov catalog (CKAN) are mainly for users who need to manage Data.gov harvest sources </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">other</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than agency data.json files. For federal agencies with established data.json harvest sources for their metadata, there is no need for an account to manage the Data.gov catalog. If you have ad hoc needs, for example to conduct a manual harvest of your agency’s data.json outside of the usual nightly harvest schedule, just contact the Data.gov team at </span><a href="mailto:datagov@gsa.gov"><span style="font-weight: 400;">datagov@gsa.gov</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Data.gov users with accounts to manage the Data.gov catalog (mainly geospatial harvest sources), the Data.gov login that previously used </span><a href="http://idp.geoplatform.gov"><span style="font-weight: 400;">http://idp.geoplatform.gov</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will now use </span><a href="https://login.max.gov/cas/login?service=https%3A%2F%2Fmax.gov%2Fmaxportal%2Fsa%2Flogin.action%3Bjsessionid%3D994E6FE4CC968B89D599672C9F9DDAAE"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OMB MAX login</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You will be sent to OMB MAX on your first login, you should </span><a href="https://login.max.gov/cas/login?service=https%3A%2F%2Fmax.gov%2Fmaxportal%2Fsa%2Flogin.action%3Bjsessionid%3D994E6FE4CC968B89D599672C9F9DDAAE"><span style="font-weight: 400;">log in to OMB MAX</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> using your OMB MAX credentials on your first use of the “new” Data.gov catalog. Two-factor authentication (2FA) is now required for Data.gov access, so enable 2FA through the instructions on the OMB MAX log in page. You can add a device by clicking on &#8220;Manage SMS 2-Factor Devices&#8221; under your profile settings. This is not necessary if you use your PIV/CAC card to log in to MAX; it is already considered 2FA. After you have logged in to OMB MAX, email us at </span><a href="mailto:datagov@gsa.gov"><span style="font-weight: 400;">datagov@gsa.gov</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to let us know that you have completed the initial login. In the email provide the organization name and access permission (Admin or Editor) that is required. We will then associate requested permissions to your account. On subsequent logins to Data.gov (through OMB MAX), you should be able to perform the actions you have privileges for on the Data.gov catalog without further assistance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have an urgent need for a change to your harvest source/schedule during the first several days post migration, please contact </span><a href="mailto:datagov@gsa.gov"><span style="font-weight: 400;">datagov@gsa.gov</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and we will make the changes for you.</span></p>
<p><b>Geoplatform.gov users (Website only)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Data.gov migration and authentication changes only affect Geoplatform.gov users who manage harvest sources for the Geoplatform.gov data catalog through </span><a href="http://catalog.data.gov"><span style="font-weight: 400;">http://catalog.data.gov</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  If you have permissions to use Geoplatform.gov for any other purpose, there is no change to your login through </span><a href="http://idp.geoplatform.gov"><span style="font-weight: 400;">http://idp.geoplatform.gov</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span> If you have questions regarding <a href="http://Geoplatform.gov">Geoplatform.gov</a>, contact <a href="mailto:servicedesk@geoplatform.gov">servicedesk@geoplatform.gov</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you manage harvest sources for the data catalog at Geoplatform.gov, please refer to the instructions for Data.gov catalog users above and follow the same instructions for logging in through OMB MAX. If you don’t have access to OMB MAX- see the section below on obtaining access.</span></p>
<p><b>Inventory.data.gov </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inventory.data.gov is the non-public system provided by the Data.gov team, mainly to assist federal agencies in managing their metadata for inclusion in the Data.gov catalog. Agency users have access to and are able to manage their own agency’s metadata only. Logins to use inventory.data.gov are also now integrated with OMB MAX. Log in on inventory.data.gov will now take you to </span><a href="https://login.max.gov/cas/login?service=https%3A%2F%2Fmax.gov%2Fmaxportal%2Fsa%2Flogin.action%3Bjsessionid%3D994E6FE4CC968B89D599672C9F9DDAAE"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OMB MAX login</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You should log in to OMB MAX using your OMB MAX credentials on your first use of inventory.data.gov post migration. Two-factor authentication (2FA) is now required, so enable 2FA through the instructions on the </span><a href="https://login.max.gov/cas/login?service=https%3A%2F%2Fmax.gov%2Fmaxportal%2Fsa%2Flogin.action%3Bjsessionid%3D994E6FE4CC968B89D599672C9F9DDAAE"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OMB MAX log in</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> page. You can add a device by clicking on &#8220;Manage SMS 2-Factor Devices&#8221; under your profile settings.

After you have logged in to OMB MAX, email us at </span><a href="mailto:datagov@gsa.gov"><span style="font-weight: 400;">datagov@gsa.gov</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to let us know you have completed the initial login, in the email provide the organization name and access permission (Admin or Editor) required. We will then associate requested permissions to your account. On subsequent logins to inventory.data.gov (through OMB MAX), you should be able to use inventory.data.gov to manage metadata as previously without further assistance.</span></p>
<p><b>Don’t have an OMB MAX Account?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are a federal government employee or a federal government contractor with a .gov email, you can </span><a href="https://max.gov/maxportal/registrationForm.action"><span style="font-weight: 400;">self register</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for an OMB MAX account.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For non-federal users (mainly managing non-federal harvest sources for Geoplatform.gov through </span><a href="http://catalog.data.gov"><span style="font-weight: 400;">http://catalog.data.gov</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ), you can obtain OMB MAX access through a federal sponsorship process. This is a relatively new process for OMB MAX that we will be working on with the federal sponsors on the Geoplatform.gov side.  We will be refining this process in the next few weeks so that federal contacts can sponsor/add non-federal users for OMB MAX more easily. Please contact </span><a href="mailto:servicedesk@geoplatform.gov"><span style="font-weight: 400;">servicedesk@geoplatform.gov</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for your patience as we complete the Data.gov migration questions and for your understanding on any initial glitches. Contact us at </span><a href="mailto:datagov@gsa.gov"><span style="font-weight: 400;">datagov@gsa.gov</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with any other questions.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are excited to launch the Maritime Topic on Data.gov, a place where the diverse datasets relevant to maritime transportation can be shared and discovered.  The marine transportation system connects people around the world, moving energy commodities, consumer goods, and agricultural products from producers to markets – and don’t forget the cruise ships that move millions of vacationers every year.  With </span><a href="http://www.cmts.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over 28 U.S. Federal Government departments, agencies, bureaus, and independent commissions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> involved in the marine transportation system there is a wealth of existing data on topics ranging from </span><a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/large-whale-incident-database"><span style="font-weight: 400;">marine mammals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/trust-fund-financial-reports-70249"><span style="font-weight: 400;">trust fund revenues</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  Whatever your interest in marine transportation we hope the Maritime Topic helps point you towards the right data for your question.  Check back for updates, highlighted datasets, and examples of how maritime data is being used across the public and private sectors.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Coastal communities are becoming increasingly vulnerable to the risk of damage from coastal inundation. We only have to remember the recent impact of Hurricane Sandy on communities in the northeast to see the potential damage that a single storm can cause. Your challenge is to create tools and provide information so communities can prepare for coastal inundation. Through the use of data, visualizations, and simulations, you can help people understand their exposure to coastal inundation hazards and their increased vulnerability due to population increase and sea level rise. <a href="https://2014.spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/coastal-inundation/" target="_blank">This challenge</a> is part of the International Space Apps Challenge, a <a href="https://2014.spaceappschallenge.org/">global collaboration</a> to solve challenges facing humanity&#8211;both on and off Planet Earth. Join a team for the event on April 12-13, 2014! Visit the <a href="/climate/climate-resources">Resources</a> section to find datasets, web services, and tools that will help you compete in this challenge related to coastal flooding and climate change.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, the Ecosystem Vulnerability theme page was unveiled during the Plenary Session of the ACES (A Community on Ecosystem Services) conference near Washington, D.C. The Ecosystem Vulnerability theme was formally launched, along with the Water theme, and the Data.gov Ecosystems community (Ecosystems.data.gov), by Interior Secretary Sally Jewell. The new Ecosystem Vulnerability theme of climate.data.gov provides a variety of data and resources to foster greater understanding of the impacts of climate change on water resources, biodiversity, the extent of invasive species, the ability of our ecosystems to sequester carbon, and the frequency and extent of wildland fires.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>(Dec 9th, 2014)</em> The U.S. government has released a collection of data and tools that will advance planning capabilities for the impacts of climate change on our nation&#8217;s ecosystems. The data and tools will provide information and will help to stimulate innovation in preparing for climate impacts on fire regimes, water availability, carbon sequestration, biodiversity conservation, ocean health, and the spread of invasive species. Here are some examples of how the data and tools could be used:</p>
<ul>
<li>Help communities and natural resource managers determine if they are currently at risk from wildfires and if they will be impacted in the future due to wildfires becoming more prevalent and severe;</li>
<li>Provide information to the public on their sources of water and their sensitivities to climate change;</li>
<li>Aid in the public understanding of the role that ecosystems play in mitigating rising carbon dioxide levels due to their absorbing and storing of carbon, as well as how land management activities may influence storage capabilities;</li>
<li>Identify the potential impacts of climate change on rare and endangered species, iconic species, and ecosystems;</li>
<li>Identify which invasive species may threaten specific locations and their impacts on local communities and their economies. This effort will contribute to early detection, rapid response activities.</li>
</ul>

<p>These data are also being made available via mapping services on Geoplatform.gov. The resources provided here can be used to explore and develop insights for a number of relevant questions, such as:</p>
<p>1) How are fundamental energy resources impacted by climate?</p>
<p>2) How might changes in climate and natural resource availability impact energy conversion infrastructure and processes?</p>
<p>3) How might climate impact energy transmission and distribution systems?</p>
<p>4) How might energy demands be impacted by climate change, including heating and cooling but also energy losses and energy used for adaptation by other sectors?</p>
<p>5) What capacity do we currently have to adapt energy systems, and how might technology solutions, systems designs, and operational changes improve energy system resilience for climate change?</p>
<p>6) How might climate change impact energy infrastructure and its interactions with networked and interconnected infrastructure systems?</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dear Open Data Enthusiasts,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below is an abstract of &#8220;Liberating data for public value: The case of Data.gov,&#8221; </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">International Journal of Information Management (2016).</span></i></p>
<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public agencies around the globe are liberating their data. Drawing on a case of Data.gov, we outline the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead for the liberation of public data. Data.gov is an online portal that provides open access to datasets generated by US public agencies and countries around the world in a machine-readable format. By discussing the challenges and opportunities faced by Data.gov, we provide several lessons that can inform research and practice. We suggest that providing access to open data in itself does not spur innovation. Specifically, we claim that public agencies need to spend resources to improve the capacities of their organizations to move toward ‘open data by default’; develop capacities of community to use data to solve problems; and think critically about the unintended consequences of providing access to public data. We also suggest that public agencies need better metrics to evaluate the success of open-data efforts in achieving its goals.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To help communities and individuals plan for the risks of climate-change-related impacts on water resources, the U.S. Government is releasing today a collection of datasets containing information relevant to this important issue. Select data are also being made available via mapping services on Geoplatform.gov. The resources provided here can be used to help answer a number of relevant questions, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>How are human and natural components of the hydrologic cycle changing?</li>
<li>How can communities and water managers plan for uncertain future conditions?</li>
<li>How will changing water resources affect food, energy, ecosystems, and human health?</li>
</ul>

This new report published data categories for marine planning that can build consistency in how we select, label, and organize data systems and search interfaces. The list of categories can be used in sorting and selecting the data that is needed for marine planning. The controlled vocabulary adds value when the terms are also used to identify data, so that automated systems can use them to sort and search. This will make it easier for regional data portals to locate the data they need, especially if the regional data providers are also using the controlled vocabulary to identify datasets useful for marine planning. Together, we are moving forward to meet the challenge of producing the data foundations for regional marine planning.  For more information, visit the following:</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today is the sixth anniversary of Data.gov. Data.gov was launched on May 21, 2009 with just 47 datasets. It currently features over 130,000 datasets from across the country including those from 83 Federal agencies and sub-agencies. Since the landmark 2013 <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/09/executive-order-making-open-and-machine-readable-new-default-government-">Executive Order</a>, which made federal data open and machine-readable by default, we have added over 50,000 datasets<sup><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup>. Annual page views on Data.gov are about 8.5 million and it has more than doubled in the past two years. As it enters its next phase of growth, Data.gov has proven that the open data movement is here to stay.</p>
<p>In February 2015, Data.gov was recognized for its technological innovations by placing in the top eight of more than 100 submissions at the <a href="https://www.data.gov/opendata/data-gov-places-top-8-finalist-2015-innovation-awards/">ACT-IAC Innovation Awards</a>. Data.gov was honored for its innovative transformation in the last year from a central metadata catalog (to which agencies submitted datasets one-by-one) to a data harvesting hub (where agency datasets are now automatically gathered on a daily basis). This provides a more structured and efficient way to share and discover federal open data and ensures that users can count on Data.gov as an up-to-date source for such data.</p>
<p>Data.gov uses open source technology to power the website (WordPress) and the data catalog is developed using CKAN (Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network). Using open source technology allows developers from around the globe to give <a href="https://github.com/GSA/data.gov/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">input</a>, and for others to re-use the code. This technology also results in greater integration with state, city, and county catalogs. Data.gov currently syndicates 37 local government data catalogs and more <a href="https://www.data.gov/local/add">are added every month</a>.</p>
<p>Data.gov is bringing transparency to the Federal Government’s open data efforts. Through the <a href="http://labs.data.gov/dashboard">Project Open Data dashboard</a>, anyone can see the performance of federal agencies in meeting the Open Data Policy requirements. The public can also weigh in on issues, and see how agencies are responding to recommendations, creating greater accountability as well.</p>
<p>Data.gov has launched several new features this year. To improve public engagement on open data, Data.gov launched its open, API-driven, customer service platform, the Data.gov <a href="https://www.data.gov/meta/announcing-data-gov-help-desk/">Help Desk</a>, which allows for the public to submit issues, improvements, and requests for government data. The status of all data issues can be publicly tracked.</p>
<p>Another new feature is <a href="https://www.data.gov/meta/open-apps/">the integration of data visualization</a> tools, giving Data.gov users the option to open datasets using third party tools like <a href="https://plot.ly/">plot.ly</a> and <a href="http://cartodb.com/">CartoDB</a>.</p>
<p>In the year ahead, Data.gov will continue to work with agency partners to take open data to another level. We will expand the scope of the catalog and improve the quality of metadata. We will develop and launch additional tools to enable agencies to release even more of their data, so that government data can continue to inform citizens and improve their daily lives.</p>
<p>From the example set by the U.S. and Data.gov in 2009, there are now over 75 national open data sites. Data.gov will continue to set the lead unleashing the power of open data around the world.</p>
<p style="font-size: .8em; font-style: italic;"><span id="footnote-1">1</span> &#8211; <strong>A note on <a href="https://www.data.gov/metrics">metrics</a></strong>: There are many nuances associated with the number of datasets on Data.gov since it syndicates many types of data from many different sources. Some datasets are grouped into collections and each dataset can include multiple resources. In total, there are currently over 4 million resources (such as individual download links) cataloged on Data.gov.  Since the first milestone of the Federal open data policy, there have been over <a href="http://catalog.data.gov/dataset?q=metadata_created%3A[2013-11-30T23%3A59%3A59Z+TO+NOW]&amp;sort=views_recent+desc&amp;metadata_type=non-geospatial&amp;organization_type=Federal+Government">50,000 Federal datasets</a> updated on the site using the <a href="https://project-open-data.cio.gov/implementation-guide/">metadata management process</a> established by the policy, but many local governments have used the same <a href="https://project-open-data.cio.gov/v1.1/schema/">metadata standard</a> to syndicate to Data.gov as well. In total there are currently over <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?organization_type=Federal+Government">98,000 Federal datasets</a> currently on Data.gov and over 30,000 from local government sources including <a href="http://catalog.data.gov/dataset?groups=local">over 10,000</a> using the same metadata standard as the Federal government.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Data.gov launches a new data driven customer service platform to request data and report problems or improvements with existing data. </strong></p>
<p>New tools are making it easier to submit complaints, comments, and petitions to your government online and through mobile applications. Data.gov is proud to announce the launch of the Data.gov Help Desk, a new customer service platform powered by Open311 that will let the public submit <a href="/issue/">issues</a>, <a href="/issue/">improvements</a>, and <a href="/request/">requests</a> for government data. You&#8217;ll now find these options on our <a href="https://www.data.gov/contact">Contact page</a>, but soon they will be integrated throughout the site. This is an open, API-driven platform for the public to voice their needs and track the status of data issues. This initial release is just the beginning, but we look forward to hearing your feedback here and on <a href="https://github.com/GSA/data.gov/issues/422">GitHub</a> to make the Help Desk feature even better. </p>
<p><a href="/request/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/bsp-ocsit-prod-east-appdata/datagov/wordpress/2015/03/datagov-data-request-form-1024x883.png" alt="datagov-data-request-form" width="50%" /></a><a href="/requests/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/bsp-ocsit-prod-east-appdata/datagov/wordpress/2015/03/datagov-data-requests-1024x883.png" alt="datagov-data-requests" width="50%" /></a></p>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>Since the beginning, Data.gov has striven to engage with the public to help software developers, researchers, and other data users find and understand the data they need. Because Data.gov is a small team, we can’t always answer questions as quickly as we would like to. Additionally, these questions are often best answered by specific government agencies and domain experts. A few years ago, we helped establish the <a href="http://opendata.stackexchange.com/">Open Data Stack Exchange</a> as a community-run resource for questions and answers about all kinds of open data, not even just government data. The Open Data Stack Exchange is a great resource which we continue to support, but there are many instances when it would be better to integrate these interactions more tightly with data publishers and specific datasets. For example, when someone is looking for a specific government dataset or wants to report a problem or suggest an improvement with an existing dataset, we’d like to make sure that the request makes it to the right agency and that data issues and improvements are tied to their dataset listings on Data.gov.</p>
<p>As part of the <a href="https://project-open-data.cio.gov/policy-memo/#c-create-a-process-to-engage-with-customers-to-help-facilitate-and-prioritize-data-release">Federal Open Data Policy</a>, agencies have been asked to provide a feedback mechanism to engage with their users and prioritize datasets for release. While some agencies like the <a href="https://ask.census.gov/newrequest.php">U.S. Census</a> have well established platforms for engaging with their users, many agencies have been limited in providing more than a basic contact form to facilitate feedback. Similarly, Data.gov hasn’t had a sophisticated process for responding to data inquiries. In the past year, Data.gov has made heavy use of <a href="https://github.com/GSA/data.gov/issues">GitHub issues</a> for publicly tracking problems and feature requests for the Data.gov website and occasionally data-specific issues come through as well, but we’ve been in need of a separate process oriented around data to properly delegate to the right folks in government. </p>
<h3 id="open-feedback-open-data">Open Feedback for Open Data</h3>
<p>Fortunately, there’s already a great model for managing citizen requests in a simple way across the complexity of government. The model of a consolidated contact center and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-1-1">311 phone number</a> in many cities has had a significant impact on the ability for people to request services and information from their government and track the progress of their request. More recently the <a href="http://wiki.open311.org/GeoReport_v2/">Open311</a> specification has made those interactions into more of a public forum and standardized the process with a common API that can be used across many different applications and governments. To date, Open311 has mostly been limited to local government, but the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2010/03/03/open-311">White House</a> has taken note in the past. </p>
<p>Since the Open311 standard already provides the foundation for a common data driven customer service platform, the Data.gov Help Desk has been built on top of it.</p>
<h3 id="open-integration">Open for Integration</h3>
<p>Working with the Open311 standard has meant that the the Data.gov Help Desk has taken an API-first approach which means that all of our tools have been developed around the same API that’s available to outside developers (also known as “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food">dogfooding</a>”). In the near future we will make this API available to a wider audience outside of government, following the same precedent as the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/10/23/new-we-people-write-api-and-what-it-means-you">White House We The People Petitions API</a>, but we will also be working closely with agencies across government so that we can use standardized APIs to integrate with their own customer service platforms and build on top of initiatives like <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/idealab/2015/03/16/identifying-harnessing-demand-drive-open-data/">Demand Driven Open Data from HHS</a>. Hopefully we can establish a precedent for a federated standardized API across government in much the same way the <a href="https://project-open-data.cio.gov/v1.1/schema/">Project Open Data schema</a> has standardized metadata across both Federal agencies and local governments. </p>
<p>This initial release of the Help Desk is just a starting point and there will be many opportunities to integrate it across Data.gov and expand its functionality. The most immediate next step will be to incorporate a Help Desk button and list existing issues around a dataset directly on the dataset page. That integration will come very soon. We’re also excited about the potential for using this along with more unstructured conversations such as those using tools like <a href="http://blog.pediacities.com/2015/02/talk-is-not-cheap/">Discourse</a>. </p>
<p>The Data.gov Help Desk is being developed in the open on Github. The primary place where you can provide feedback on the feature is <a href="https://github.com/GSA/data.gov/issues/422">issue #422</a> in the main Data.gov repository, but other components have their own repositories: <a href="https://github.com/GSA/open311-simple-crm">Open311 Simple CRM</a>, <a href="https://github.com/GSA/wp-open311">and Open311-WP</a>. With the <a href="https://github.com/GSA/open311-github">GitHub Open311 Adapter</a>, we’re also looking at the possibility of using GitHub Issues itself as a backend that can be served with this same API standard. We’re excited to build this not just as a platform, but as part of a broader ecosystem for engagement around data. We look forward to your participation. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Data.gov now enables the public to open data directly with apps like Plotly and CartoDB for robust visualization and analysis.</strong></p>
<p>New tools are making it easier to visualize and analyze data at the click of a button. Data.gov is proud to announce integration with two of these tools — <a href="https://plot.ly/">Plotly</a> and <a href="http://cartodb.com/">CartoDB</a> — making it possible to create graphs and dynamic maps with open government data in one click.</p>
<p>On supported datasets, a new “Open With” menu will appear giving you the option to open the dataset directly with these third party services. No need to download and upload, just click the link and go.</p>
<p><a href="http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/alternative-fueling-station-locations-b550c"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/bsp-ocsit-prod-east-appdata/datagov/wordpress/2015/03/open-with-datagov.png" alt="open-with-datagov" width="100%" /></a></p>
<h3>Plotly</h3>
<p>Plotly converts datasets into collaborative graphs and data visualizations for the web. With Plotly you can create and customize a variety of interactive visualizations: bar, line, and scatter graphs, heat maps, area graphs, bubble chart, histograms, linear regressions, box plots, 3D graphs, and more. More advanced users can crunch data with any custom function, (including derivatives, integrals, inferential or descriptive basic statistics, chi-squared test, T-test, and ANOVA) and create simulations with Python scripts. To view existing data visualizations with Plotly, you can explore their <a href="https://plot.ly/feed/">graphing news feed</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/bsp-ocsit-prod-east-appdata/datagov/wordpress/2015/03/plotly.png" alt="plotly" width="100%" /></p>
<h3>CartoDB</h3>
<p>CartoDB converts geospatial datasets into dynamic customizable maps for the web in seconds. Once the map is automatically created users can filter and refine the visualized data to gain insights and tell stories. Users can customize the appearance of the maps through a variety of beautiful themes and advanced users can leverage CartoCSS, a cascading style sheet language for maps. To see the potential of CartoDB, their website has a <a href="http://cartodb.com/gallery/government">gallery of maps using government data</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/bsp-ocsit-prod-east-appdata/datagov/wordpress/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-18-at-9.52.09-AM-1024x632.png" alt="CartoDB Map" width="100%" /></p>
<p>Both Plotly and CartoDB make it easy to share and edit your work privately, with your co-workers, or the world. There is so much to learn from open government data and we are happy to feature tools like Plotly and CartoDB that make it easier for everyone to become a data scientist. If you create a great data visualization with Data.gov data please <a href="https://www.data.gov/contact">let us know</a>!</p>
<h3>With More to Come</h3>
<p>The integration with Plotly and CartoDB is made possible with nothing more than simple website links and Data.gov will be expanding these options to include other third party services in the future.</p>
<p>The “Open With” menu is currently made available for smaller CSV and XLS files and will not appear when these files are not verified as a functioning CSV or XLS file. Other file formats are also supported, such as KML and zipped Shapefiles for use with CartoDB, but currently Data.gov does not validate these file formats before providing the link. In some cases, the format specified in dataset metadata on Data.gov does not accurately reflect the linked file. If you come across a dataset that is labeled as a CSV or XLS file and the “Open With” menu is not present it is either because the file is too large or because the link does not point directly to the CSV or XLS file.</p>
<p>Data.gov will continue to work with data publishers to update these listings and ensure that the “Open With” menu works for more datasets and connects with even more services.</p>
<p>If you have feedback about the “Open With” menu, please <a href="https://www.data.gov/contact">contact us</a> or leave a comment here or on <a href="https://github.com/GSA/data.gov/issues/602">GitHub</a>. We look forward to seeing what you create as you open data with new insight.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img style="width: 100%;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/bsp-ocsit-prod-east-appdata/datagov/wordpress/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-03-at-11.00.00-AM-1024x658.png" alt="Screen cap of dataportals.org map or dataportals around the world" /></p>
<p>Data.gov is the central clearinghouse for federal open data, including hosting the Public Data Listings required under the 2013 Federal Open Data Policy, but Data.gov also hosts state, local, and tribal government sources voluntarily. As of this writing Data.gov has the open data catalogs of 10 cities, 3 counties, and 8 states open data catalogs piped to Data.gov, in addition to many local geospatial data sources, but we know there are many more open data catalogs <a href="https://github.com/sunlightpolicy/opendata/blob/master/USlocalopendataportals.csv">out there</a>!</p>
<p>Getting your local government open data plugged into Data.gov is likely easier than you think. We recently outlined the technical process of how data gets harvested onto Data.gov in detail with our <a href="https://www.digitalgov.gov/resources/how-to-get-your-open-data-on-data-gov/">“How to Get Your Open Data on Data.gov</a>” guide. The gist of which is: Data.gov harvests standard metadata and there a slightly different requirements for federal data, federal geospatial data, and non-federal data. For state, county, and city data Data.gov simply <a href="https://www.digitalgov.gov/resources/how-to-get-your-open-data-on-data-gov/#non-federal-data">needs two things</a> from a government contact:</p>
<ol>
<li>A data.json file (this is likely built into your open data catalog, but an open data catalog is not required, see<a href="http://www.data.gov/faq"> www.data.gov/faq</a>).</li>

<p>With those two items, Data.gov can set up nightly harvests that will automatically update Data.gov with your local data.</p>
<p>Local governments should get their data on Data.gov first and foremost because it will help make local open data more discoverable, but also because it supports <a href="https://project-open-data.cio.gov/v1.1/schema/">a minimal metadata standard</a> across local open data efforts, can help identify emergent data trends and standards (like the <a href="http://us-city.census.okfn.org/">US City Open Data Census</a>) across local governments, and because it shows the international open data community how active the United States is!</p>
<p>To all local government officials, we would love to hear from you and connect your government data to Data.gov as soon as possible. As always, If you have any questions, you can reach out to <a href="mailto:datagov@gsa.gov">datagov@gsa.gov</a>.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the new home of <a href="http://open.fda.gov/" target="_blank">openFDA</a>! We are incredibly excited to see so much interest in our work and hope that this site can be a valuable resource to those wishing to use public FDA data in both the public and private sector to spur innovation, further regulatory or scientific missions, educate the public, and save lives.</p>
<p>Through openFDA, developers and researchers will have easy access to high-value FDA public data through <a href="http://apievangelist.com/index.html">RESTful APIs</a> and structured file downloads. In short, our goal is to make it simple for an application, mobile, or web developer, or all stripes of researchers, to use data from FDA in their work. We&#8217;ve done an extensive amount of research both internally and with potential external developers to identify which datasets are both in demand and have a high barrier of entry. As a result, our initial pilot project will cover a number of datasets from various areas within FDA, defined into three broad focus areas: Adverse Events, Product Recalls, and Product Labeling. These API&#8217;s won&#8217;t have one-on-one matching to FDA&#8217;s internal data organizational structure; rather, we intend to abstract on top of a myriad of datasets and provide appropriate metadata and identifiers when possible. Of course, we&#8217;ll always make the raw source data available for people who prefer to work that way (and it&#8217;s good to mention that we also will not be releasing any data that could potentially be used to identify individuals or other private information).</p>
<p>The openFDA initiative is one part of the larger Office of Informatics and Technology Innovation roadmap. As part of my role as FDA&#8217;s <a href="http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/ucm349836.htm">Chief Health Informatics Officer</a>, I&#8217;m working to lead efforts to move FDA in to a cutting edge technology organization. You&#8217;ll be hearing more about our other initiatives, including Cloud Computing, High Performance Computing, Next Generation Sequencing, and mobile-first deployment in the near future.</p>
<p>As we work towards a release of openFDA we&#8217;ll begin to share more about our work and how you can get involved. In the meantime, I suggest you sign up for our listserv (<a href="http://open.fda.gov/">on our home page</a>) to get the latest updates on the project. You can also reach our team at <a href="mailto:open@fda.hhs.gov">open@fda.hhs.gov</a> if there is a unique partnership opportunity or other collaboration you wish to discuss.</p>

As the national archive for multibeam bathymetric data, NGDC manages over 15 million nautical miles of ship trackline data from sources worldwide. In 2011, NGDC, in partnership with NOAA&#8217;s National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), initiated a new archive for high resolution data collected with sonars capable of mapping the water column.</span></p>
<p class="indent" style="color: #363636;"><span>Water column sonar data are collected on NOAA fishery survey vessels and academic and international fleets, and are used to assess the physical and biological characteristics of the ocean. Primary uses include 3-D mapping of fish schools and other mid-water marine organisms, assessing biological abundance, species identification, and habitat characterization. These data are also useful for evaluating underwater gas seeps, remotely monitoring undersea oil spills, and bathymetry.</span></p>
<p class="indent" style="color: #363636;"><span>NGDC is working with scientists at NMFS and the Joint Hydrographic Center to ensure the long-term preservation and world-wide dissemination of these data.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Using Participatory GIS to Map Ocean Uses in the Mid-Atlantic</strong></em><br />
Thursday, May 1, 2014 from 2 to 3 p.m. Eastern</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Presenter(s)</span>: Mimi D&#8217;Iorio (National Oceanic and Atmospheric<br />
Administration), Laura McKay (Virginia Coastal Zone Management Program),<br />
Nick Meade (Virginia Coastal Zone Management Program), Jeanne Herb (Rutgers<br />
University)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Description</span>: Understanding human uses of the ocean is essential to successful marine<br />
planning. Unfortunately, spatial data on ocean uses are often limited and<br />
difficult to capture consistently over large areas. Participatory<br />
geographic information system (PGIS) processes provide interactive ways to<br />
capture local knowledge and ocean use patterns through specialized GIS<br />
mapping tools. NOAA has been working with partners all over the country to<br />
apply this method at local and regional scales. This webinar will be a<br />
panel discussion with NOAA and its partners in the mid-Atlantic region<br />
focused on the process, data, and lessons learned.</p>
<p>In this webinar, participants will:</p>
<p>&#8211; Learn about the NOAA PGIS method for capturing ocean use data and<br />
where it has been applied;<br />
&#8211; Hear insights from the mid-Atlantic team that has taken the process<br />
from one state to the entire region for marine planning applications; and<br />
&#8211; Gain a better understanding about the data, products, and often<br />
unexpected outcomes of PGIS projects.</p>

<p style="color: #222222;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Presenter(s):</span> Jeff Adkins and Linwood Pendleton</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">A lot of people’s livelihoods depend on the resources of the oceans and Great Lakes. Economics: National Ocean Watch (ENOW) is the only nationally consistent data set that is focused on monitoring the ocean and Great Lakes economy. These time-series data report the establishments, employment, wages, and gross domestic product for six ocean-dependent sectors. ENOW provides data for about 400 counties, 30 coastal states, 8 regions, and the nation. This webinar will be an interactive dialogue between Duke University Nicholas Institute scholar Linwood Pendleton and NOAA economist Jeff Adkins. They will be sharing highlights and data development methods, related international efforts, and ways in which the data can be used to improve coastal and ocean management.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">In this webinar, participants will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get an overview of ENOW data and methods</li>
<li>Understand the value of the U.S. ocean and Great Lakes economy</li>
<li>Learn how to apply data for coastal and ocean management</li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">While Data.gov lists its holdings at almost 400,000 datasets, the fact is, Data.gov is the link to millions of public datasets. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Many Federal agencies post their data collections on Data.gov as single entities. In addition, Data.gov is host to tools, widgets and gadgets that each accesses thousands of datasets.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">These collections run the gamut of topics. For example:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://explore.data.gov/Other/2011-Code-of-Federal-Regulations-in-XML/icbq-beqy"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #0000ff; font-size: medium;">2011 Code of Federal Regulations in XML</span></a><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">. It’s not surprising that the codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Federal agencies would reach 100 MB in size.</span></span></li>
<li><a href="https://explore.data.gov/Geography-and-Environment/Bureau-of-Land-Management-General-Land-Office-Reco/rm2y-d8hv"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #0000ff; font-size: medium;">Bureau of Land Management, General Land Office (GLO)  Records System</span></a><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">. About 10 million records. The GLO holds U.S. land title information images, including patent images, survey plats, field notes and master title plats.</span></span></li>
<li><a href="https://explore.data.gov/Geography-and-Environment/Bureau-of-Land-Management-General-Land-Office-Reco/rm2y-d8hv"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #0000ff; font-size: medium;">EPA Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO) Exporter Data</span></a><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">. ECHO shares data related to water, air, waste, and drinking water regulations, along with information on facilities violating the Clean Water Act and tools that compare water quality trends and generate interactive maps that link to state dashboards.</span></span></li>
<li><a href="https://explore.data.gov/Agriculture/Farmers-Markets-Geographic-Data/wfna-38ey"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;">Farmers Market Geographic Data</span></a><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">. Longitude and latitude, state, address, name, and zip code of nearly 8,000 Farmers Markets in the United States.</span></span></li>

<li><a href="https://explore.data.gov/Business-Enterprise/Patent-Grant-Bibliographic-Text-1976-Present-/8du5-jxih"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;">Patent Grant Bibliographic Text (1976-present</span></a><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">). </span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;">With 4,000 patents being issued each week, this database contains about <strong>10 million records</strong>. Like many agencies, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office is a wealth of data. We’ve also got </span><a href="http://www.data.gov/business/datasets/patent-classification-bimonthly-files-1790-present"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #0000ff; font-size: medium;">the Patent Classification Files since 1790</span></a><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Data.gov is not about the numbers but the quality of our holdings. Still, it’s important to realize that a vast storehouse of data can be found behind just one little click.</span></span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Data.gov is pleased to announce the launch of a <a href="http://catalog.data.gov/">new data catalog</a> on an open source data management system called <a href="http://ckan.org/">CKAN</a> used by the data portals of the U.K., Germany, Brazil, and a number of other governments around the world.</p>

<p>The new catalog consolidates all of Data.gov’s holdings in one easy-to-use catalog. It features a number of improvements, such as an improved search that helps you find all the datasets for a particular location, such as your zip code, better sorting and tagging of datasets, and improved metadata. Data.gov now has one unified data catalog based on an open source standard that will make it easier to federate with other federal agency catalogs, as well as those of <a href="http://www.data.gov/states/community/states">states</a>, <a href="http://www.data.gov/cities/community/cities">cities</a>, and <a href="http://www.data.gov/counties/community/counties">counties</a>. The new CKAN catalog will also enable the implementation of the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bsp-ocsit-prod-east-appdata/datagov/wordpress/2013/10/omb/memoranda/2013/m-13-13.pdf">Open Data Policy</a>, as it will easily harvest the data inventories that federal agencies will be creating under the policy. The result will be a user-friendly, comprehensive catalog that will allow citizens, developers and others to fully take advantage of the vast array of federal data that affects the daily lives of citizens.&nbsp;</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>May 21, 2012 marks the third anniversary of the U.S. government’s open data site, Data.gov. The first national open data site, Data.gov led the way in opening government data around the world. Now 30 countries host open data sites and they are key tools in the global open government movement.</p>
<p>Growing from 47 datasets in 2009 to nearly 450,000 datasets today, Data.gov reaches across 172 federal agencies to bring data to innovators, developers, analysts and citizens across the nation. The data shows up in smart phone apps, websites, and information that lets people buy smarter, use energy more efficiently, and find better health-care solutions each day.</p>
<p>Over the past year alone, Data.gov has not only added more datasets, it has added more opportunities for interaction with them, and more opportunities for collaborating and sharing information both nationwide and around the world. In fact, President Obama’s Open Government <a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/sites/www.opengovpartnership.org/files/country_action_plans/US_National_Action_Plan_Final_2.pdf">U.S. National Action Plan</a> considers Data.gov an important tool to spur innovation in the United States and around the globe.</p>
<p>Data.gov has become a gathering spot for those with shared interests through its topic-based communities. Expanding these communities is a key priority of President Obama’s <em>U.S. National Action Plan</em>, which heralds six Data.gov communities: – Education, Health, Law, Energy, Safety, and Research.</p>
<p>These communities bring together experts from the public, academia, industry, and government to address the national challenges in energy, health, and law, and this year new communities launched on safety, education, manufacturing, oceans, ethics, developers, and business. From organizing challenges to inspire new innovations to supporting code-a-thons in cities, to building platforms for entrepreneurs to find new technologies and grow their businesses—Data.gov is putting federal data to work for Americans. <br /> Join the celebration, discover new information, and find ways to get more from your money, your time, and your business. Visit Data.gov!</p>
<p>Data.gov is managed by the General Services Administration’s Office of Citizen Services and Innovative Technologies working with the U.S. Chief Information Officer and U.S. Chief Technology Officer.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;<span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Recently, we marked another milestone in Data.gov’s evolution. Members of the Open Knowledge Foundation met in Washington, D.C., with the Data.gov team and Federal Agencies to discuss the next iteration of Data.gov.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Within months, Data.gov will see major enhancements around its data catalog, how the data is managed and the ease with which the data can be used. The most obvious change visitors will find is a single catalog that combines Data.gov and Geo.Data.gov. For the first time, nongeospatial datasets and geospatial datasets will be in one place. You’ll also find improved search capabilities, with a broader reach across the Executive Branch. Thanks to “Data.gov 2.0” code’s incorporation into the Open Government Platform (OGPL), Data.gov will be even more open and compatible with sites around the world as well. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;">These new features are due to the software that will support Data.gov’s data management: CKAN. </span><a href="http://ckan.org/"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #0000ff; font-size: medium;">CKAN</span></a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;"> is an open-source data management system used around the world, including by the </span><a href="http://data.gov.uk/"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #0000ff; font-size: medium;">United Kingdom</span></a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;"> (U.K.) and by </span><a href="http://publicdata.eu/"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #0000ff; font-size: medium;">Europe’s brand new open-data site</span></a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;">. Its developer, the U.K.-based </span><a href="http://okfn.org/"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #0000ff; font-size: medium;">Open Knowledge Foundation</span></a><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">, is a nonprofit that works with people worldwide to promote increased transparency and engagement, in part through making CKAN available for open data sites. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">A launch of the new and improved Data.gov is planned for later this spring.</span></span></p>

From the moment the doors opened at 7:30 am, the air was punctuated with the sound of languages from across the globe. Scientists, policy makers, and leaders from the non-profit and development community all shared a day of discovery and connection around the unlimited opportunity in open data for agriculture.</p>
<p style="margin: 10px 0px; padding: 0px; color: #333333; font-family: georgia, 'Georgia Ref', 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;">Secretary Vilsack kicked off the proceedings with a speech that focused the day. “Data is quickly becoming one of the most important commodities in agriculture,” he told the attendees, and encouraged the sharing of data to magnify its power.&nbsp; He also compared the digital revolution fueled by open data to the industrial revolution, in that data sharing has the same potential to accelerate development of new tools that will bolster the productivity of farmers around the world.</p>
<p style="margin: 10px 0px; padding: 0px; color: #333333; font-family: georgia, 'Georgia Ref', 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;">As head of the U.S. delegation, he announced the launch of the federal government’s contribution to these efforts: the&nbsp;<a style="color: #993300; text-decoration: none;" href="http://www.data.gov/food/community/food">Food, Agriculture and Rural</a>&nbsp;data community, which offers a catalog of over 300 data sets as well as numerous apps, tools and statistical products.

The community was launched in hopes that farmers, researchers, data analysts, businesses and governments will use it to locate, download and utilize food, agriculture and rural data to address serious social, economic and environmental concerns.</p>

Gates emphasized the importance of open data to entrepreneurship and innovation.&nbsp; Other speakers included U.S. Chief Technology Officer Todd Park and Vice President of the World Bank Dr. Rachel Kyte.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AFTER a Soviet missile shot down a South Korean airliner that strayed into Russian airspace in 1983, President Ronald Reagan made America’s military satellite-navigation system, GPS, available to the world. Entrepreneurs pounced. Car-navigation, precision farming and 3m American jobs now depend on GPS. Official weather data are also public and avidly used by everyone from insurers to ice-cream sellers.</p>
<p>But this is not enough. On May 9th Barack Obama ordered that all data created or collected by America’s federal government must be made available free to the public, unless this would violate privacy, confidentiality or security. “Open and machine-readable”, the president said, is “the new default for government information.”</p>

First is a comprehensive listing of the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.data.gov/developers/page/developer-resources">application programming interfaces</a>&nbsp;(APIs) that were released from across the federal government as part of the Digital Government Strategy. These APIs will fuel the development of new apps on everything from health, public safety, education, consumer protection, and many more topics of interest to Americans. Developers can find all the government’s APIs in one place, with links to API documentation and other resources.</p>
<p>Data.gov is also launching a new&nbsp;<a href="http://catalog.data.gov/">data catalog</a>&nbsp;on an open source data management system called&nbsp;<a href="http://ckan.org/">CKAN</a>&nbsp; The new catalog features a number of enhancements, such as an improved search that helps you find all the datasets for a particular location, better sorting and tagging of datasets, and more robust metadata. Data.gov now has one unified data catalog based on an open source standard that will make it easier to federate with other federal agency catalogs, as well as those of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.data.gov/states/community/states">states</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.data.gov/cities/community/cities">cities</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.data.gov/counties/community/counties">counties</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">A huge milestone was reached yesterday with the relaunch of the<a href="http://catalog.data.gov/dataset"> U.S. government data portal</a> on a single,<a href="http://ckan.org/"> open source platform</a>. A joint collaboration between a small UK team at the<a href="http://okfn.org/"> Open Knowledge Foundation</a> and data.gov, this was an ambitious project to reduce the numerous previous catalogs and repositories into one central portal for serious re-use of government open data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://catalog.data.gov/dataset">Catalog.data.gov</a> brings together both geospatial as well as “raw” (tabular or text) data under a single roof in a consistent standardised beautiful interface that can be searched, faceted by fomat, publisher, community or keyword as well as filtered by location.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Until November 9, 2013, search results on Next.Data.gov and data.gov may differ.</b></p>
<p><i>Why? </i>On May 9, 2013, President Obama issued an <span style="text-decoration: underline">Executive Order</span> (and OMB issued an <span style="text-decoration: underline">accompanying policy memo</span>) making “open” the new default for non-sensitive federal government data.</p>
<p>Before this shift, agency representatives would log on to a central database at Data.gov and enter information about the datasets they wanted to make public. All of these dataset entries are preserved and you can search them on Data.gov today – but <span style="text-decoration: underline">no new datasets will appear on Data.gov until November 9, 2013.</span></p>
<p>Going forward, federal agencies need to maintain their own data inventory listings at <i>agency</i>.gov/data by November 9, 2013. Starting November 9, Data.gov will regularly crawl all of these inventory listings to power one central search engine at Data.gov, eliminating the manually-updated central database. <b>Until this transition point, all crawled agency inventory listings will be searchable at Next.Data.gov.</b> As agencies bring their new data inventory listings online and/or add new dataset listings, they will appear on Next.Data.gov (and <i>not</i> on Data.gov).</p>
<p>On November 9, 2013, Next.Data.gov will become the new Data.gov.</p>
<p>As we get closer to November 9, more and more agencies will have their data catalogs up, and we anticipate that every agency catalog will include all of the datasets originally listed on Data.gov as well as newly-listed data. In other words, the closer we get to November 9, the more robust the search results on Next.Data.gov will become.</p>
<p>Until November 9, we recommend searching <i>both</i> Data.gov and Next.Data.gov for the most comprehensive results.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><P>Last week, President Obama <A href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/07/08/remarks-president-presenting-new-management-agenda" target=_blank>talked about the importance of opening government data to the American people</A>, so entrepreneurs and business owners can use those troves of information to create jobs and solve problems that government can’t solve by itself. In remarks last Monday, he noted many examples of the Administration’s progress toward making that happen, saying:</P><br />
<P><EM>“At Data.gov, you can search through and download more than 75,000 data sets – data on everything from what different hospitals charge for different procedures, to credit card complaints, to weather and climate measurements.”</EM></P><br />
<P class=rteindent1>Today, we’re excited to share a sneak preview of a new design for Data.gov, called <A href="http://www.data.gov/" target=_blank>Next.Data.gov</A>. The upgrade builds on the President’s May 2013 <A href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/09/executive-order-making-open-and-machine-readable-new-default-government-" target=_blank>Open Data Executive Order</A> that aims to fuse open-data practices into the Federal Government’s DNA.&nbsp;<A href="http://www.data.gov/" target=_blank>Next.Data.gov</A> is far from complete (think of it as a very early beta), but we couldn’t wait to share our design approach and the technical details behind it – knowing that we need your help to make it even better.</P></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="stcpDiv">There are many companies that are currently using USDA data. <a href="http://www.mercariscompany.com/">Mercaris</a> is a new company filling in the gap in offerings with reliable market data and an online trading tool tailored to the organic and non-GMO production, processing, and retail industries. Their reports present current and archived market condition information to assist in pricing decisions. <a href="http://farmlogs.com/">FarmLogs</a> provides comprehensive farm management software-as-a-service to farmers managing farms ranging from small-scale to over 30k acres. Their platform supports a hybrid of government and farmer-generated data that is analyzed and incorporated into their decision-making tools.</p>
<div>
<p>USDA wants to continue to encourage additional innovations and solutions by providing the data and statistics necessary that will offer improved agricultural production, global food security, poverty, nutrition and human health, natural resources and environmental issues, rural development, local and regional food systems, and many other issues.</p>
<p>Therefore, in support of the Open Data Policy, USDA officially launched the U.S. Government’s new <a href="http://www.data.gov/food/community/food" target="_blank">Food, Agriculture and Rural virtual community</a> on<a href="http://data.gov/" target="_blank"> Data.gov</a>. This community serves as a single access point for our databases, tools, apps and other data resources discussed throughout the <a href="http://blogs.usda.gov/tag/g-8-international-conference-on-open-data-for-agriculture/" target="_blank">G-8 Open Data for Agriculture conference</a>. For example, USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS) will be releasing a model for scenario analysis and projecting the long-run food security status in three developing countries.  Similar to how the coding community collaboratively builds applications, researchers and others will be able to learn from the models and build upon them to spur other research studies. This supports the <a href="http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome?contentidonly=true&amp;contentid=digitalstrategy.html" target="_blank">USDA Digital Strategy</a> efforts to ensure high-value services and systems are available anywhere, any time and on any device.  USDA has also developed a comprehensive catalog of all data assets that are available to the public on <a href="http://www.usda.gov/Data" target="_blank">www.USDA.Gov/Data</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the USDA featured datasets and tools include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://search.ams.usda.gov/farmersmarkets/" target="_blank">USDA National Farmers Market Directory</a> helps connect farmers and consumers, communities and businesses around the country. And, thanks to wider use of smartphones and enhanced search tools like our <a href="http://blogs.usda.gov/2013/06/04/taking-hack-tion-for-food-farmers-and-america/" target="_blank">directory API</a>, consumers can search for farmers markets using mobile phone apps while on-the-go (see related <a href="http://blogs.usda.gov/2013/08/07/meet-me-at-the-market-the-evolution-of-a-farmers-market/" target="_blank">blog post</a>).</li>
<li>The recently announced <a href="http://nassgeodata.gmu.edu/VegScape/" target="_blank">VegScape tool</a> provides data and mapping capacity from our satellite-based U.S. crop condition vegetation assessment and monitoring web service.</li>
<li>The Germplasm Resource Information Network  (<a href="http://www.ars-grin.gov/" target="_blank">GRIN) Global</a> is a powerful and easy-to-use, web-based information management system for the world’s plant genebanks, providing access to plant genetic resources in the face of challenges such as crop diseases and pests.</li>
<li>The community also features some new <a href="http://www.data.gov/food/page/statistics" target="_blank">statistical</a> products that support the U.N. Global Strategy for Agriculture and Rural Statistics.</li>
<li>USDA’s Economic Research Service launched an API and <a href="http://www.ers.usda.gov/developer/charts-of-note-widget.aspx?chartId=37396" target="_blank">widget</a> for programmatic access to their daily visualization series <a href="http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/charts-of-note.aspx" target="_blank">Charts of Note</a> (see related <a href="http://blogs.usda.gov/2013/05/23/usda-ers-moving-down-the-track-to-open-data/" target="_blank">blog post</a>), along with <a href="http://www.ers.usda.gov/developer/">APIs</a> to select data sets (including GIS applications).</li>
<li>USDA has also completed building a dynamic <a href="http://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/api" target="_blank">API</a> for the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) Quick Stats data. <a href="http://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/" target="_blank">Quick Stats</a> is the best source of agricultural census and survey data published by NASS</li>
</ul>
<p>Working with you, <strong>USDA is committed to prioritizing the release of additional data sets based on feedback from the public</strong>.  As part of that effort, at this year’s Open Government Partnership summit the Department of Agriculture lead the U.S. delegation in collaboration with the UK Government, Gates Foundations, World Wide Web Foundation, and over 60 others from public and private sectors launched the <a href="http://www.godan.info/" target="_blank">Global Open Data for Agriculture and Nutrition</a> (GODAN) Initiative. Participants will focus on building high-level policy and institutional support for open data worldwide.</p>
<p>If you have questions about the catalog, or suggestions regarding which USDA data sets would be most valuable if they were made available, please leave a comment here on our blog, or at USDA’s API issue tracker: <a href="https://github.com/USDA/USDA-APIs/issues" target="_blank">https://github.com/USDA/USDA-APIs/issues</a></p>

<div id="stcpDiv">
<p>Data consumers can now more easily leverage several of the most popular offerings from USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS)!</p>
<p>To meet the needs of a growing community of data users, including application developers and researchers, ERS has just released seven new APIs (Application Programming Interface), enriched with shared services provided by other Federal agencies.  The APIs offer dynamic access to ERS’s atlases, traditional data sets, and indicators in machine-readable formats.  ERS has developed rigorous <a href="http://ers.usda.gov/about-ers/information-quality/ers-data-product-policy-recommendations-and-standards.aspx">standards</a> for data products; users will note the extensive metadata and full documentation and transparency provided for each of the data sets via APIs.</p>
<p>Experienced users may want to dive into the thorough documentation available on ERS’s <a href="http://ers.usda.gov/developer">Developer page</a>; while those seeking a simpler path can leverage pre-built widgets and starter-code snippets available in jQuery, Python, and Ruby.  The geospatial APIs provide access to map layers via ESRI (or other mapping services, such as Mapbox and Google Maps).  The newly released APIs supplement the following data sets:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/arms-farm-financial-and-crop-production-practices.aspx"><strong>ARMS Farm Financial and Crop Production Practices</strong></a><strong>:</strong> The primary source of aggregated information on the financial condition, production practices, resource use, and economic well-being of farm businesses and households.</li>
<li><a href="http://ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-dollar-series.aspx"><strong>Food Dollar</strong><strong> Series</strong></a>: This economic model output of annual expenditures by U.S. consumers on domestically produced food shows how a dollar spent on food is allocated across supporting industries, including marketing, processing, legal and accounting, transportation, and sourcing raw goods.</li>
<li><a href="http://ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-access-research-atlas.aspx"><strong>Food Access Research Atlas</strong></a><strong>: </strong>A variety of indicators on food access and supermarket accessibility in the U.S. measured at the census tract level are available as map layers.</li>
<li><a href="http://ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-environment-atlas.aspx"><strong>Food Environment Atlas</strong></a>: Present a wider set of statistics on food choices, health, and well-being, including proximity to food sources, prices, assistance programs, and community characteristics in the U.S.</li>
<li><a href="http://ers.usda.gov/data-products/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-%28snap%29-data-system.aspx"><strong>Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Data System</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Participation and benefit levels for SNAP recipients at the State and county level.  Geo-tagged data is available in a series of mapping services.</li>
<li><a href="http://ers.usda.gov/data-products/farm-program-atlas.aspx"><strong>Farm Program Atlas</strong></a><strong>:</strong> The availability and extent of insurance, conservation, marketing, and other Federal programs available to farmers.</li>
<li><a href="http://ers.usda.gov/data-products/atlas-of-rural-and-small-town-america.aspx"><strong>Atlas of Rural and Small-Town America</strong></a><strong>:</strong> A spatial interpretation of county-level, economic and social conditions along four dimensions: people, jobs, agriculture, and county classifications. Over 60 socioeconomic indicators available as map layers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Data queries/functionality in the APIs match those of the data products, applications, and atlases already offered.  This increases the value and utility of public data, and enables greater interaction with ERS data in machine-readable formats, such as mashing up with other data sets and/or processing for new insights. ERS is committed to expanding and enriching accessibility and transparency via Open Data strategies.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Data.gov Team Moves to New Location</h3>
<p>As this is posted today, the Data.gov team has re-located to our new “greener” General Services Administration (GSA) building in One Constitution Square in Northeast Washington, D.C.   These new surroundings, optimized for open collaboration, are filled with new opportunities and possibilities.  This new work environment epitomizes the key characteristics of the Data.gov team – nimble, collaborative, adaptive, and forward-leaning (to new horizons)!  Our physical address may have changed but our digital, virtual addresses (e-mail, phone, PDA, and web) in the digital domain remain the same as our transition was seamless and flawless.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; width: 100%;"><img loading="lazy" title="" alt="New GSA building" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/bsp-ocsit-prod-east-appdata/datagov/wordpress/2013/10/images/new_gsa_building.jpg" width="194" height="186" /></p>

<h3>The International Open Government Data Conference (IOGDC) was a Rousing Success!</h3>
<p style="text-align: center; width: 100%;"><img loading="lazy" title="" alt="International Open Government Data Conference 2010" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/bsp-ocsit-prod-east-appdata/datagov/wordpress/2013/10/images/iogdc2010_quote.jpg" width="232" height="231" /></p>
<p>By all accounts and feedback, the International Open Government Data Conference (IOGDC) held in November in Washington DC was a rousing success!  It attracted nearly 400 people from around the world to discuss, explore, and celebrate the great strides taken in opening up government data.  From Australia to the United Kingdom, from Poland to Vietnam, experts shared the lessons they had learned in creating open data movements, developing apps, and analyzing government data.  Many thanks to everyone who attended and made those three days such a rich experience for all of us.</p>
<p>Data.gov sponsored the conference to bring together so many of the people who have been meeting independently in this area.  Recently, developers have been hosting and attending “<a href="http://www.opendataday.org/">hack-a-thons</a>” and “<a href="http://www.data.gov/communities/node/116/story/119">mash-a-thons</a>.”  Government executives have been meeting to formulate policy decisions.  Security experts have been investigating the issues related to the release of data.  But … these have happened independent of each other.  The IOGDC brought many of these people together to share the conversation and shape the vision for the future of open government data.</p>
<p>We converged on the U.S. Department of Commerce auditorium, we shared knowledge formally and informally—believe it or not, open government data people are incredibly passionate and committed about their work—and we launched a new community among those committed to using and making available government data worldwide.  Check out the postings in the <a href="http://www.data.gov/opendata">community site</a> or review the “blow-by-blow” events from the &gt;1,700 tweets on #IOGDC!</p>

<h3>Open Government Data Perspectives and Progress around the Globe were Illuminating</h3>
<p style="text-align: center; width: 100%;"><img loading="lazy" title="" alt="Dave McClure from GSA, myself, Richard Best from New Zealand, Trevor Smallwood from Australia, and Stephen Walker from Canada" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/bsp-ocsit-prod-east-appdata/datagov/wordpress/2013/10/images/iogdc2010_panel.jpg" width="352" height="265" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Dave McClure from GSA, myself, Richard Best from New Zealand, Trevor Smallwood from Australia, and Stephen Walker from Canada sharing lessons learned about open government data implementations.</p>
<p>Nearly 400 participants came from 5 continents, 13 nations, and 31 federal agencies.  It was evident that a lot of progress has been made in the U.S. and abroad since the launch of the Open Government Initiative and Open Government Directive (OGD) and Data.gov in 2009<em>.  The paradigm shift from “protect everything and share what you must” to “share everything and protect what you must” (but still comply with National Security, Privacy and Information Quality Regulations) based on the President’s vision and the Attorney General guidelines were important to the open data movement and phenomenon. </em> Hearing about the great work by each of the government organizations in the U.S. and abroad was the highlight of the conference.   The progress was palpable and measurable.</p>
<p>You should check out the amazing progress made by the participant countries and how they are addressing challenges and opportunities with pragmatic solutions:</p>

<p>It is obvious that we are forming a powerful Open Data community across the globe.  People have already contacted me about the next IOGDC event based on the incredible amount of positive energy, knowledge sharing, goodwill, and possibility for greater good that was experienced at the conference.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Key Epiphany</span>:  At the risk of waxing philosophical, I have observed that we tend to learn from each other continuously.  No one has the monopoly on the best ideas.  We keep building on each other’s ideas, innovations and success that can become a force multiplier for a greater good!  As Spock said, “The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one.”  But you knew that.…</p>
<h3>Practice what you preach!</h3>
<p>We’ve been practicing what we have been preaching:</p>
<ol style="list-style-position: outside; margin-left: 30px;">
<li>You can find all the speakers listed and presentations <a href="http://www.data.gov/conference/agenda">here</a> for the three days of amazing discussions!  We loaded all the presentations immediately on the Data.gov website and we were lauded by many for our openness, transparency, and quick response</li>
<li>We participated and coordinated with the <a href="http://opengovernmentdata.org/camp2010/">Open Government Data Camp: 2010</a> that took place in London, U.K. that week, speakers traveled from one conference to the other, we cross-posted twitter hash tags, we held discussions in both of the community spaces, and we have created an ongoing series of conversations at multiple levels (policy, technical, developers, and citizens) to grow a truly international view and shared space of open government data.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: center; width: 100%;"><img loading="lazy" title="" alt="Open Government Data Camp 2010" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/bsp-ocsit-prod-east-appdata/datagov/wordpress/2013/10/images/ogdc2010.jpg" width="232" height="105" /></p>
<p>Finally, we tracked the efforts of the <a href="http://www.opendataday.org/">International Open Data “Hack-a-thon” day</a> on December 4, 2010, which attracted thousands of people in over 73 cities on five continents.  Application developers from around the world looked at data available from many data.gov sites to create better ways to get information to citizens to make decisions.</p>
<h3>Harvard Business Case Study Provides Key Insights on Data.gov</h3>
<p style="text-align: center; width: 100%;"><img loading="lazy" title="" alt="Harvard Business Case Study" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/bsp-ocsit-prod-east-appdata/datagov/wordpress/2013/10/images/case_study.jpg" width="232" height="134" /></p>
<p>I mentioned last time that Harvard Business School had published a case study about Data.gov.  As Data.gov’s senior executive, I was especially proud and pleased to present Harvard Business School (HBS) Assistant Professor Karim Lakhani at the IOGDC, who discussed the recent HBS case study on Data.gov, the <a href="http://www.data.gov/documents/hbs_datagov_case_study.pdf">full text</a> of which is available on the Data.gov site. Harvard studied Data.gov to better understand Federal CIO Vivek Kundra’s groundbreaking ideas behind it:</p>
<ul style="list-style-position: outside; margin-left: 30px;">
<li>Move government data to the web</li>
<li>Make data available in raw, machine-readable format</li>
<li>Encourage people to use the data</li>
<li>Harness the wisdom of crowds beyond government to drive innovation</li>
</ul>
<p>What was the result? BETTER GOVERNMENT!</p>
<p>The HBS case study pulls together the best history—word that seems slightly pretentious since we have barely celebrated our first anniversary—of Data.gov from the major players. We have accomplished much in the past year: hosting more than 300,000 datasets, launching apps competitions based on the data, and encouraging use of the data by researchers, developers and the greater public&#8211;“putting the data to work” is how we like to describe it.  However, the HBS assessment of the way forward is what excites me most.</p>
<p>The HBS case study brings in voices from across the open government data environment, including Ellen Miller from the Sunlight Foundation, Tim O’Reilly of O’Reilly Media, Dave Campbell of Microsoft, along with those of the U.S. Federal government, to discuss Data.gov’s challenges and opportunities. We are in new, uncharted territory. How do we make the most data available while maintaining individual privacy and security? How do we find and assemble a community of experts to create best practices in using U.S. government data? We feel that the recent conference was a big step in this direction.</p>
<p>It’s time to take the open data movement to the next level—we need to create the international communities, topics, and focus areas that need to be addressed as a global community.  I encourage you to read this case study and contact me with your ideas—let me know what you’re doing so we can move forward together.</p>
<h3>Stay involved and tuned—new communities of data are coming …</h3>
<p>Join in the discussions in the <a href="http://www.data.gov/opendata">open data</a> or <a href="http://www.data.gov/semantic">semantic</a> communities and stay tuned as new communities in health, economics, climate, and law come to life in the next quarter of fiscal year 2011….</p>
<p>Many on our team will take some much-needed leave this month after working assiduously and continuously for a long while – we shall all re-emerge re-charged, renewed and rejuvenated in 2011!  I wish all of you a safe, joyous, and prosperous Holiday Season!   Let good data set you free …</p>

<p><!--break--></p>
<p>As of May 2011, the available editions of eGRID contain data for 2007, 2005, and 2004 (all in eGRID2010) and for 1996 through 2000 (in the archived edition). &nbsp;Data for 2007 were configured to reflect the electric power industry’s current structure as of December 31, 2010, including plant ownership and operators, parent company affiliations, company mergers, and grid configurations. TranSystems|E.H. Pechan, formerly E.H. Pechan &amp; Associates, Inc., has developed all seven editions of eGRID for EPA since 1997.</p>
<h3>Data Summary</h3>
<p>eGRID data include emissions, emission rates, electricity generation, resource mix, and heat input.&nbsp; eGRID data also include plant identification, location, and structural information. The following emissions information is included in eGRID:</p>
<ul>
<li>carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)</li>
<li>nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>)</li>
<li>sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>)</li>
<li>methane (CH<sub>4</sub>)</li>
<li>nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O)</li>
<li>carbon dioxide equivalent (CO<sub>2</sub>e)</li>
<li>mercury (Hg)</li>
</ul>
<p>CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>O are greenhouse gases (GHG) that contribute to climate change. NO<sub>x</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> contribute to unhealthy air quality and acid rain in many parts of the country. Hg is a toxic pollutant that can adversely affect exposed nervous systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>eGRID&#8217;s resource mix information includes the following resources:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>coal</li>
<li>oil</li>
<li>gas</li>
<li>other fossil</li>
<li>nuclear</li>
<li>hydroelectric (water)</li>
<li>biomass (including biogas, landfill gas and digester gas)</li>
<li>wind</li>
<li>solar</li>
<li>geothermal</li>
</ul>
<p>The primary data sources used for eGRID include data reported by electric generators to EPA’s Clean Air Markets Division (pursuant to 40 CFR Part 75) and to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).</p>
<h3>Uses of eGRID</h3>
<p>eGRID data are used for carbon footprinting; emission reduction calculations; calculating indirect greenhouse gas emissions for The Climate Registry, the California Climate Action Registry, California’s Mandatory GHG emissions reporting program (AB 32) , and other GHG protocols.&nbsp;&nbsp; EPA tools and programs such as <a href="http://www.epa.gov/powerprofiler">Power Profiler</a> (which has been updated with 2007 data from eGRID), <a href="http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=evaluate_performance.bus_portfoliomanager">Portfolio Manager</a>, the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/greenpower/pubs/calculator.htm">Green Power Equivalency Calculator</a>, the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/cleanenergy/energy-resources/calculator.html">Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator</a>, the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/emissions/ind_calculator.html">Personal Greenhouse Gas Emissions Calculator</a>, and the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/osw/partnerships/wastewise/carboncalc.htm">WasteWise Office Carbon Footprint Tool</a> use eGRID.&nbsp; Electricity labeling/environmental disclosure, Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) and Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) attributes are often supported by eGRID data. &nbsp;State and local governments also rely on eGRID data for emissions inventories and for policy decisions.&nbsp; eGRID is used extensively for electric grid related research by nongovernmental organizations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In 2010, Executive Order 13514 was issued, requiring Federal agencies to “measure, report, and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions from direct and indirect activities.” The Federal GHG Accounting and Reporting Guidance accompanied this order and recommended using eGRID non-baseload emission rates to estimate the Scope 2 (indirect) emission reductions from renewable energy.</p>
<p>The company SAP has taken eGRID data and made an online visualization of eGRID subregion, NERC region, and state data.&nbsp; See:&nbsp; <a href="http://experience.sap.com/experience/html/Pages/egrid/dashboard.html">http://experience.sap.com/experience/html/Pages/egrid/dashboard.html</a> .&nbsp; This application is under review.</p>

<h3><strong>Accessing eGRID Data</strong></h3>
<p>In addition to Data.gov, eGRID is also available on EPA’s website at <a href="http://www.epa.gov/egrid">epa.gov/egrid</a>. &nbsp;Year 2007 data in eGRID2010 are presented in three Excel workbooks. The first workbook contains data at the boiler, generator, and plant levels. The second workbook presents aggregated data by state, electric generating company, parent company, power control area, eGRID subregion, NERC region, and the U.S. &nbsp;The third workbook contains state import-export data for 2004 and 2005, as well as U.S. generation and consumption data. &nbsp;The eGRID2010 Technical Support Document, File Structure, Summary Tables (with regional representational maps), and GHG Annual Output Emission Rates for CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>O (for GHG inventory and registry work) are included in Adobe PDF files.
