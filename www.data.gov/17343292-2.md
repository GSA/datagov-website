1. What areas currently are at greatest risk of coastal flooding?
2. What areas are going to be impacted in the future as sea level rises?
3. In what areas are there additional factors that add to the risk?
4. Where are vulnerable populations, infrastructure, and sectors in relation to the flooding risk areas?
5. What analyses can be done to quantify current and future potential impacts?
6. Can we quantify how natural and built environments can contribute to resilience to coastal flooding?
